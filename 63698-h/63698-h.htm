  <h2 class='c010'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c011'>In the Biographical Sketches contained
in this volume, I have
pursued the same system as in
my two former Catalogues, of the
Galleries of Hinchingbrook and Longleat,—devoting
especial attention to the immediate
members, or to personages in any way connected
with the family in question. In the historical
characters, I have purposely made the details
of public and official life (which are elsewhere
recorded) subservient to those of a private and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_IX'>IX</span>domestic nature, although it is obvious that
in some cases the two cannot be disentangled.
In fact, I have preferred painting my portraits
in the costume worn at home, rather than in
robes of office and suits of armour. I have refrained
from mentioning the innumerable authorities
to which I have had recourse, in the British
Museum and other Public and Private Libraries,
from a dread of adding to the weight of a
volume already, I fear, too bulky. For help in
my labours, I am indebted to the noble owner
of Panshanger himself, for the able papers on
Charles James Fox, Lord Melbourne, and the
brothers De Witt,—while the author of that
delightful memoir, ‘Fifty Years of my Life,’ so
well known to the reading public, contributed
the interesting sketch of his ancestor, the first
Earl of Albemarle.</p>

<p class='c012'>The good services of Mr. Elliot Stock procured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_X'>X</span>me the assistance of Monsieur Charles
Rueles, the learned Keeper of Manuscripts in
the Royal Library at Brussels, when at a
loss for information regarding the Marquez de
Leganes, a commander little spoken of by
English writers. On the kindness of friends
my impaired sight has compelled me to rely
for details of dress and descriptions of many
of the portraits, and, on this account, my especial
thanks are due to a fair member of the Cowper
family. In other respects, the work, it may be
‘a poor thing, is mine own,’ and, although in
some respects arduous and difficult, I have found
it on the whole an undoubted labour of love.</p>

HE was the second son of the Duke de Bouillon,
by Elizabeth of Nassau, daughter of William
the Silent and Charlotte de Montpensier.
De Bouillon was attached in early
life to Henry the Fourth, King of France
and Navarre, who spoke of him as ‘my
lieutenant, my friend, and comrade.’ The Duke was a soldier,
diplomat, politician, and man of letters; and, moreover,
founder of the Academy at Sedan, which became the resort of
all the youthful nobility and chivalry of Europe.</p>
<p class='c012'>The Duke was one of the chief leaders of the Calvinistic
party, and in their tenets he brought up his two sons, the
Prince de Sedan and the Vicomte de Turenne. When the
education of the elder was completed, he went to Holland to
learn the art of war, under his uncle Maurice, Prince of Orange,
while Henry continued his studies at home. In early childhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>his constitution was far from robust, which inclined the
Duke to destine him for some civil employment; but the
little Vicomte had set his whole heart on being a soldier, and
he was resolved to prove to his father that the decision he had
come to was ill-founded. He took, in consequence, rather an
ingenious method of manifesting his health and strength.
One evening the boy contrived to elude the vigilance of his
governor, who spent hours of anxious search, and never discovered
the truant till the next morning, on the ramparts of
the town. On the carriage of a cannon, where he had passed
the whole night, lay the little fellow, smiling in his calm
sleep over the dreams which had visited his iron pillow,—visions,
in all probability, of the daring exploits of some of his
beloved heroes of antiquity, or some brilliant foretaste of his
own future glory. But a still more characteristic anecdote is
told of Turenne’s boyhood. He took great delight in lecturing,
as it were, to a group of admiring listeners, on the merits of
his favourite historian, Quintus Curtius, or the mighty deeds
of Alexander the Great. In such moments his eye would
kindle, his whole face brighten, and he would overcome that
hesitation of speech under which he laboured in calmer
moments. One eventful day an officer (of mature years), who
was in the company, ventured to speak disparagingly of Henry’s
favourite historian, and even to question his veracity! This
was too much for the impetuous boy; he waxed wroth, and
answered the attack with indignation, to the infinite amusement
of his mother, who was present. She made a sign to the
officer to prosecute the argument, till the Vicomte de Turenne,
with all the offended dignity of his ten years, left the room in
a towering passion, and the same evening challenged the
officer to mortal combat. The ‘cartel’ was carried to the
Duchess, who was much delighted with this early development
of her son’s military ardour. The challenge was of
course accepted, the place of rendezvous settled, and thither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the small hero hastened the next morning, ‘his soul in arms,
and eager for the fray.’ To his surprise he found his mother
on the ground, and the officer by her side, while on the green
turf at their feet was spread a goodly banquet. The Duchess
advanced with a smile, and embracing her son told him she
had come to act as second to his antagonist, but that they
must first breakfast, upon which the three sat down, together
with the gentlemen of the hunt, who were also there assembled,
and during the repast, as may easily be believed, peace was
concluded, the honour of the young firebrand appeased, and
an exhilarating gallop put an end to all discord.</p>

<p class='c012'>Henry was only twelve when his father died; he remained a
year longer at home, during which time he showed a far greater
taste for athletic and military exercises than for sedentary
studies; above all, he delighted in horsemanship, and the more
unmanageable the steed, the more willingly would Henry
mount it. Hearing that the Comte de Roussy (afterwards his
brother-in-law) had brought a charger from Paris that was considered
wild and vicious, he never rested till he had it saddled,
and leaped on its back, in spite of the expostulations of the
whole household. In a short time the juvenile Alexander
returned from his triumphant ride, having tamed the modern
Bucephalus! When thirteen, the Duchess sent him to join
his brother at the Court of the Stadtholder; Maurice received
him graciously, but insisted on his entering the army as a
private soldier. The Prince died a very short time after
Turenne’s arrival in Holland, but the youth had already
imbibed those lessons of military tactics, and that reverence
for discipline, which, added to his own talents and aptitude
for the service, stood him in good stead his life long.
Henry Frederic, Maurice’s successor as Stadtholder and
commander-in-chief, continued his protection to Turenne, and
gave him the command of a regiment of infantry, which soon
became a model of discipline. Under his uncle’s auspices, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>young soldier now commenced active service; in 1629 he
distinguished himself more especially at the siege of Bois-le-Duc,
a fortress known as La Pucelle de Brabant.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not our intention to make a list of the military exploits
of this great man, whose campaigns in Lorraine, Italy, Germany,
etc., would fill many volumes, and indeed form part of the history
of France, or rather of Europe. While his brilliant victories,
his skilful retreats, and, for the most part, his successful diplomatic
negotiations, established his lasting fame, we shall only
enumerate those which are necessary to a narrative of this
nature. In the early days of which we are now speaking,
Turenne’s valour and thirst for enterprise were so remarkable
that Prince Henry Frederic deemed it advisable to reprimand
the young soldier for his rashness, with (it may be conceived)
but ill-concealed admiration for his prowess. The Prince said
one day to some officers who were standing near him, ‘If I
mistake not, Turenne will one day rival our greatest captains
in fame and glory.’ Turenne remained five years in the service
of Holland, when his mother, who had been engaged in
political negotiations with France, sent him to that country,
where the King and his Prime Minister, Cardinal Richelieu,
received him most graciously, and gave him the command of a
regiment of foot in the French army. At the siege of La Motte
he mounted the walls in person, and carried the bastion, for
which he was rewarded with the bâton of a field-marshal—a
grade only second to that of Marshal of France,—being an
honour almost unheard of for a young man of three-and-twenty.
His humanity was equal to his valour. During the privations
and hardships of the retreat from Mayence in 1635, the Marshal
exerted himself to the utmost to alleviate suffering. He
caused many of the valuable contents of his own baggage-wagons
to be thrown away, in order to provide room for the
weary and wounded; he shared his own provisions with the
common soldiers, consoling and helping all those who were in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>need, without distinction of rank or nationality. Never
slackening for one moment in his military duties, which he
pursued with untiring zeal, at the siege of Saverne, foremost,
as usual, in mounting the breach, his arm was struck by a
musket-ball, and for some time it was believed amputation
must ensue. The recovery was slow and tedious, but long
before it was complete the Marshal had resumed his duties.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1638 he became a lieutenant-general, on being sent to
the relief of Duke Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, with whom an
alliance had been formed by France. In 1646 he returned to
Paris, to the Court, where the Prime Minister, Cardinal
Mazarin, whose recognition of his great services had hitherto
been but lukewarm, was loud in his commendation, and offered
him the Duchy of Château Thierry, and the hand of one of
his beautiful and well-dowered nieces; but Turenne refused
all these offers, from the conviction that some of the conditions
therein involved would prove prejudicial to the interests
of his brother, the Duke de Bouillon, to whom he was warmly
attached. He was defeated by the Comte de Mercy, in command
of the Bavarians at Mariendal, but made a most skilful
retreat, and by the side of the Prince de Condé took his
revenge at the battle of Nordlingen, where Mercy was routed,
and received his death-wound. This brave general was buried
near the place where he fell, and his tomb bore this inscription:
<i>Sta, Viator, Heroem Calcas</i>. Turenne then marched
to join the Swedish General Wrangel, the friend and comrade
of the great Gustavus Adolphus, in Hesse, and was preparing
for fresh warfare when the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia
gave peace to Central Europe, concluding the Thirty Years
War. A most flattering letter to the Vicomte de Turenne was
written by the Elector of Mayence, the Duke of Würtemberg,
and many other Princes and Ambassadors, attributing this
happy event as much to his military exploits as to the efforts
of the Plenipotentiaries.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>France did not long enjoy the blessings of peace for civil
war was now about to shed its baneful influence over the land.
Anne of Austria, the Queen-Mother and Regent (during Louis
the Fourteenth’s minority), was almost entirely under the
influence of her Prime Minister, Cardinal Mazarin, who was
very unpopular with the Parliament and the greater part of
the French nation. The successes of the English Parliamentarian
troops over those of the Royalists, and the downfall of
the Monarchy, had given a strong impetus to the anti-Court
party in France, and a faction was formed, well known in
history as the ‘Fronde.’</p>

<p class='c012'>This nickname was given to the party who were opposed
to the policy of the Queen-Regent, Anne of Austria, and her
favourite and adviser, Cardinal de Mazarin, whose measures
they condemned as unjust and oppressive. One of the
principal adherents was the Cardinal de Retz, or Coadjutor,
as he was called, a turbulent and intriguing spirit; but it soon
numbered among its members the most important and noble
names in France. The designation of <i>Frondeurs</i> was given
by a contemporary writer, from the word <i>Fronde</i>,—<i>Anglicè</i>, a
sling. He likened the malcontents to boys who went
about the streets slinging stones, till put to flight by the
appearance of any officer of the law. By degrees the faction
assumed a much more imposing form, and though the name
remained, it had certainly lost its significance. Discontent
increased every day, the people clamoured for redress of grievances,
and deputations flocked to Parliament to entreat the
interference of the members against the oppressions of the
Court. The Parliament was divided into three different
factions,—the Frondeurs aforesaid, the Mazarinists, who
supported the Cardinal, and the Modérés, who blamed the
<i>ultra</i> views of both parties. Three members in particular
rose up as champions of the oppressed, and so incensed the
Queen by their seditious language, that she caused them to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>arrested. This was the signal for open revolt: shops were
closed, streets blocked, barricades formed, and the liberty of
‘the fathers of the people,’ as they were called, loudly and
insolently demanded. Anne of Austria showed courage
and determination, arguing that compliance would be a
fatal admission of weakness; but the Duke of Orleans and
the Cardinal, alarmed for their own safety and property,
overruled her decision. The captives were released, and
the Court departed hastily to St. Germains, a step which
was designated as ‘l’enlèvement du Roi.’ The popular
party was triumphant, and the Cardinal de Retz, considering
it a favourable opportunity, exerted himself to gain
proselytes, and the malcontents soon numbered among
their adherents such men as the Dukes de Bouillon, de
Lorraine, de Beaufort, de Longueville, de la Rochefoucauld,
and the Prince de Conti, brother of the great Condé, with
many others. They were also rich in noble female partisans,
‘les héroines de la Fronde.’ Beauty, birth, and talent
swelled the list of the fair conspirators,—Mademoiselle de
Montpensier, ‘la grande demoiselle,’ as she was called,—the
Duchesses de Chevreuse and de Bouillon, the Princess Palatine,
and last, but least in no sense of the word, the Duchesse
de Longueville. When Anne of Austria deserted her post at
Paris, a rival in power, a superior in youth and beauty,
reigned for a time paramount in her stead,—the charming
despot of an elective monarchy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Anne Généviève de Bourbon was at one time so nearly
connected with the fortunes of Turenne that we are tempted
to give some details respecting her eventful life. Her father
was Henry, Prince de Condé (or ‘Monsieur le Prince,’ as the
head of that illustrious house was always called), her mother
the beautiful Charlotte de Montmorency, daughter of the
Grand Connétable of that name. They were both imprisoned
in the Château de Vincennes, where their daughter was born in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the year 1618. Mademoiselle de Bourbon was educated at the
Convent of the Carmelites, where she showed a decided bias
towards the vocation of a recluse, and a corresponding aversion
to the idea of a life at Court, or in the great world. A
very short experience, however, of admiration and success
entirely changed her views, and she became one of the most
lovely <i>précieuses</i> of the Hôtel Rambouillet. The cynosure
of all eyes, a crowd of suitors clustered round her, none of
whom found favour in the sight of her parents, till the Duc
de Longueville presented himself. He was her senior by
many years, and still under the influence of a former mistress,
the Duchesse de Montbazon; but he came of an illustrious
family, and was not far removed from the rank of a prince of the
blood-royal; and Mademoiselle de Bourbon had the paternal
commands laid upon her to receive him as her bridegroom.
At first she showed the greatest possible repugnance to the
marriage, but there was no alternative; and she walked to the
altar, radiant in beauty, and gorgeously attired, assuming a
cheerfulness of demeanour which belied the feelings of her
heart. From that time forward the young Duchess gave herself
up to a system of cold-blooded coquetry, which had most
disastrous results. We quote an eloquent description from
the pages of her biographer, Ville Flore: ‘Un an s’était à
peine écoulé, que la blanche robe de la jeune mariée avait
déjà des táches de sang, et que sans même avoir donné son
cœur elle faisait naître involontairement la plus tragique querelle,
oû Coligny perissait à la fleur de l’âge par la main d’un
de ces Guises, auquel elle avoit été un moment destinée. Prélude
sinistre des orages qui l’attendaient.’ Adorers crowded
round her, poets sang her praises, novels were written of which
she was the peerless heroine, and still Généviève de Longueville
proceeded on her triumphal march, careless and fancy-free,
making conquest after conquest, creating cabals and jealousies
that became political feuds,—the Court now taking part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>against, now with, the beautiful syren. ‘Mais on ne badine pas
éternellement avec l’amour.’</p>

<p class='c012'>M. de Masillac (or as we will call him by his better-known
title, the Duc de la Rochefoucauld, to which he
shortly succeeded), who had once been loved, and was now
hated, by Anne of Austria, laid siege to the fortress which
had held out so long, and carried the heart of the Duchesse
de Longueville by storm. Witty, handsome, cynical, reserved,
and self-contained, with a reputation already established for
valour and intellect, La Rochefoucauld soon gained a complete
ascendency over this daughter of the proud house of
Condé.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was a man who, for the most part, practised what
he preached and expounded in his world-famed ‘Maxims,’ and
whose character, drawn by his own pen, showed how the head
preponderated over the heart in his composition. That he
admired the Duchess there can be no doubt:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Pour mériter son cœur,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Pour plaire à ses beaux yeux,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>J’ai fait la guerre aux rois,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Je l’aurais fait aux dieux.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>But his first advances were unquestionably made in cold
blood, and it was in the hope of gaining proselytes to the
cause of the Fronde that he desired the alliance and co-operation
of this beautiful woman. Touched and flattered by the
simulated passion of so remarkable a man, the Duchess gave
herself up, heart and soul, to her lover, obedient to his every
wish, submissive to his every direction. She forgot her pride
of birth and position, her marriage vows, and the tender affection
which had hitherto bound her to her elder brother. Let
us hear how the man for whom she made such sacrifices
speaks of her in the early days of their <i>liaison</i>: ‘Ses belles
qualités étaient moins brillantes à cause d’une tâche qui ne
s’est jamais vue en une princesse de ce mérite, qui est, que
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>bien loin de donner la loi à ceux qui avaient une particulière
adoration pour elle, elle se transformait si fort dans leurs
sentimens qu’elle ne reconnaissait point les siens propres.’
And so he despised the very quality for which he had wooed
her,—a palpable moral!</p>
<p class='c012'>Madame de Motteville testifies that ambition had little
part in Madame de Longueville’s proceedings. She was
only ambitious for her lover,—‘qui étoit peut-être plus intéressé
qu’il n’était tendre.’ Among her proselytes she gained
over her younger brother to the cause; her husband also
was nothing loath to join the Fronde. But La Rochefoucauld,
when he thought to win the great Condé through the
medium of his sister, had reckoned without his host. Madame
de Longueville used all her powers of persuasion, vainly
appealing to the tender memories of home and childhood, but
Condé was implacable. He upbraided his sister with her
dishonour, expressed his aversion to La Rochefoucauld, and
joined the Court at St. Germains, where he assumed the command
of the troops that had remained faithful to the King,
and shortly afterwards marched upon Paris to attack the
Frondeurs, who had named his brother, the Prince de Conti,
their ‘Generalissimo.’ Now the Duchesse de Longueville had
excused herself from joining her mother, the Princesse de
Condé, who was at St. Germains in attendance on the Queen,
on the plea of her approaching confinement. But the delicacy
of her situation did not prevent her acting under the orders
of her despotic lover. She shared all the perils and hardships
of her friends the Frondeurs, assisted at the parades and
reviews of the troops and the civic guard, took part in all the
military discussions, and in fact transformed the Hôtel de
Longueville into a barrack.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this state of strife and discord both sides concurred
in the advisability of gaining over Marshal Turenne to their interests,
and he, being now in command of the French army
in Germany, received the most flattering letters from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Queen and her Minister. Mazarin was profuse in his offers
of civil and military aggrandisement; renewing the proposal
of an alliance with his richly-dowered niece at the same time
that he complained to Turenne of the disloyalty of his brother,
the Duc de Bouillon.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Marshal’s answer was manly and straightforward to all
these flattering advances. He wrote respectfully indeed, but
said this was not a moment for men to think of their own personal
advancement. He regretted the disaffection of his brother,
and deeply deplored the troubles that reigned in France; he
stigmatised the blockade of Paris as a most dangerous step,
declined with courteous thanks the offer of the matrimonial
alliance on the score of difference of religion, and told his
Eminence plainly that, if he continued to oppress the people,
he (Turenne) could no longer hold out to him the hand of
friendship; moreover, that on his return to France, at the
head of his troops (according to orders from headquarters), he
was resolved neither to favour the revolt of Parliament nor
the injustice of the Minister. It was reserved for the seductive
arts of a syren to lead the hero astray from the straight
path he had chalked out for himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Duchesse de Longueville had already made a deep
impression on the proverbially susceptible heart of the
Vicomte de Turenne. About the time of the signing of the
Treaty of Westphalia, when she joined her husband at
Münster, the hero had on that occasion held a review of all
the troops under his command to do honour to the beautiful
sister of his former brother in arms, the Prince de Condé.</p>

<p class='c012'>But to return to the time of which we are treating: the
Marshal assembled his soldiers, and made them a formal
address, in which he expressed his regret at the state of affairs
in France, and assured them that on their return he would
use all his influence to persuade the King to go back to Paris,
and to take measures for checking the maladministration of
the Cardinal. He would also use his best endeavours to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>obtain the pay (with considerable arrears) that was owing to
the troops, both French and auxiliary; and, not content with
spoken words, he published a manifesto to the same effect.
The Regency, indignant at Turenne’s independent manner of
proceeding, and confident that they could not reckon on his
co-operation, caused him to be superseded in his command;
and to reconcile the soldiers (with whom he was very popular)
to this step, they sent them out considerable sums of money.
Turenne calmly resigned his post, exhorted the men to loyalty
and obedience, and repaired with some friends and followers
to Holland, there to await more peaceful times. Before long
the Court and the malcontents came to terms by what was
called the Peace of Ruel. Deputies from both sides met and
negotiated, an amnesty was proclaimed, posts and governments
were offered to the chief Frondeurs, and concessions of
all kinds served out, as sops to the disaffected.</p>

<p class='c012'>The wily Cardinal knew his world. Turenne had little
ambition, in the common acceptation of the word, no greed
of gold or worldly advancement, as to office, or the like;
but his pride of birth was a ruling passion, and dearly did he
love anything that tended to the glorification of his family.</p>

<p class='c012'>To his brother, as head of the house, he paid a species of
obedience, as to a suzerain,—a line of conduct he pursued
towards his nephew, though still a youth, on succeeding to the
title. All these things considered, it is not to be wondered at
that Turenne was delighted when he received the news that
patents had been granted to himself and his brother (with
other concessions to the elder), entitling them and their descendants
to the dignities and privileges of Princes of the
blood-royal. He hastened back to Paris, and was received
by the Cardinal with outward signs of welcome. But breakers
were ahead. The peace was a hollow one, leaving both
parties in much the same condition: the Cardinal and the
Parliament each preserving authority as before,—the one over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the Court, the other over the people. The Prince de Condé
was always at issue with the Minister, whom he treated with
ill-concealed contempt; and his Eminence, wearied and perplexed
by the exigencies and requirements of the great man,
and maddened by his sarcasms, plotted his ruin.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Duchesse de Longueville, who watched all passing
events with vigilance, chose this opportunity to renew her overtures
of reconciliation to her brother; and she not only succeeded
in so doing, but persuaded Monsieur le Prince to give
in a half-and-half adhesion to the cause of the Fronde, in
which party he had many friends, and perhaps more enemies.</p>

<p class='c012'>Among the most inveterate of the latter was the Cardinal
de Retz, at this moment on friendly terms with the Court; and
it was by the joint arrangement of the two Churchmen that
a step was taken which rekindled the torch of public discord.
The Queen-Regent had also lately been much incensed
against the Prince de Condé, who had shown himself wanting
in respect and deference to her Majesty; and petty intrigues
of all kinds were at work against him.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the 18th of January 1650, as the Princes of Condé,
Conti, and the Duc de Longueville entered the Royal
Council-chamber, they were arrested, and sent off without
a moment’s delay to the Château de Vincennes. This step
caused a panic among their friends, who dispersed in all directions.
The Duchesse de Longueville left Paris by night with
a large escort, headed by her adorer, the Duc de la Rochefoucauld,
and repaired to Normandy, to raise the inhabitants
of the province against the King, in which undertaking, however,
she was unsuccessful. Turenne took his way to Stenai,
a stronghold belonging to the Prince de Condé, and openly
avowed his indignation at the imprisonment of the Princes.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘On prétend’—we again quote his <i>Mémoires</i>—‘que l’amour
pour la sœur eût autant de part aux fausses démarches du
vicomte que l’amitié pour le frère.’ Be this as it may, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>was soon joined by the Duchess; and in answer to all the
flattering missives sent him by the Cardinal, and the offers
of high military commands and the like, he declared his
determination not to return to his allegiance until the Princes
were set at liberty. He also wrote to the Queen, expostulating
with her on the step she had taken, and pointing out that such
a man as the great Condé was far more worthy her confidence,
on account of his birth and character, and the military services
he had rendered his Sovereign, than the Cardinal, who was
an object of aversion to the country at large,—arguments which
had no effect on the Royal mind. It appears that the Duchess
was not as grateful to Turenne as he had hoped, her <i>liaison</i>
with the Duc de la Rochefoucauld interfering with the
Marshal’s claim; but so great an adept in the arts of
coquetry doubtless knew how to keep her most valuable
ally betwixt hope and despair for some time. He had
certainly transferred his loyalty from Queen Anne to Queen
Généviève, for the Duchess gave herself all the airs of a
sovereign—levying an army, publishing manifestoes, and even
concluding treaties. She sold her diamonds, an example
which was followed by the obedient Marshal, who disposed
of his splendid silver plate in order to raise troops. He
collected together all those who adhered sufficiently to the
Princes to serve in their behalf, together with those over
whom he exercised a personal influence,—some of whom he
received into the citadel, and others he stationed round the
walls of Stenai. These were soon dispersed by the Royal
troops, and Turenne, finding himself reduced to straits,
listened once more to the suggestions of his evil genius, and
under her auspices concluded a treaty with the Spaniards, in
order to obtain money and auxiliaries to assist in the deliverance
of the captives. The Marshal did not take a step so
foreign to his nature without regret, and indeed remorse, and
the treaty was concluded with many stringent conditions.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>He again wrote to the Queen, pointing out to her the horrors
of a war which would be cruel, for that her son would be
opposed to his subjects on the one hand, and to her own
brother on the other; but she paid no heed to his advice.
He therefore placed himself at the head of the Spaniards,
and commenced a march which was for a while successful,
besieging and carrying many places of importance.</p>

<p class='c012'>But his foreign troops caused him great trouble and annoyance,
refusing to obey his commands, or to march on Vincennes.
He was defeated with great loss at the battle of
Rhetel, in spite of his personal valour, which never failed,
and he felt this disaster acutely. It is related of him that,
some time afterwards, being asked by a flippant young officer
how it chanced that he lost the battles of Mariendal and
Rhetel, he replied with calm dignity, ‘By my own fault.’</p>

<p class='c012'>Still bent on the deliverance of the Princes, Turenne was
about to proceed to Vincennes without the assistance of the
Spaniards; but the prisoners had been already removed elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hopes of peace began to dawn on the distracted country.
The Ducs de la Rochefoucauld and de Bouillon, the Princesse
de Condé and her young son, who had been leagued together
against the Court, now tendered their submission, and repaired
to the Royal camp at Bourg in person, pledging themselves
in future not to take arms against the King. These proud
spirits carried their newly-born loyalty so far, that, on entering
the presence of their Majesties, they knelt down to solicit
pardon.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘La reine les reçut avec bonté, et le Cardinal Mazarin leur
donna à dîner.’ But the release of the Princes was not to be
effected without cabals and intrigues of all kinds. The Queen
was hardly pressed on the subject, and at length she was compelled
to dismiss her Minister, and to promise pardon to the
captives. The Marshal de Grammont was named as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>bearer of the good tidings to Condé and his companions,
but the Cardinal stole a march on him, and contrived to
appropriate all the honour of the transaction, by forestalling
De Grammont’s journey.</p>

<p class='c012'>He repaired to Havre, where the Princes were now imprisoned,
entered their presence, and, offering them the hand
of friendship, announced to them that they were at liberty.
They then dined together (for it seemed a hobby of Mazarin’s
to cement a reconciliation at the banqueting-table), after which
his Eminence departed for Cologne, while the Princes took
their way to Paris. Here they were received with acclamations,
and bonfires were lighted in honour of their release,—a
similar demonstration having been made the year before
to commemorate their imprisonment!</p>

<p class='c012'>The Duke of Orleans, the Duc de Beaufort, the Cardinal
de Retz himself, were all loud in their professions of welcome
and friendship, and there was much embracing on the occasion.
Turenne, on learning the news, returned to Stenai, whence he
wrote to the Prince de Condé, begging him to use his newly-regained
influence with the Court to bring about an honourable
peace with Spain.</p>

<p class='c012'>Condé’s answer was eloquent of gratitude and friendship,
and, in accordance with the Marshal’s wish, a Parliamentary
counsellor was sent to Stenai with powers to negotiate. He
was also bearer of a letter from the King to the Vicomte
de Turenne, wherein Louis offered a free pardon to the
Marshal, and all those who had taken arms with him against
the Crown, on condition they returned to their allegiance.
The letter concluded with these words: ‘J’ai la bonne volonté
pour ce qui regarde votre personne, et les intérêts de votre
maison, et je prie Dieu, mon cousin, qu’il vous ait en sa sainte
et digne garde.—<span class='sc'>Louis.</span>’</p>

<p class='c012'>This was followed by the exchange that had so long been
talked of,—the town of Sedan for places of far greater importance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and many advantageous concessions to the house
of De Bouillon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Turenne failed in his mediation between France and Spain,
and having found the King of the last-named country unreasonable
in his demands, he gave up the attempt and
returned to Paris.</p>

<p class='c012'>Discovering that it was the intention of the Princes to give
him a public reception, Turenne defeated their intentions by
arriving a day sooner than was expected, for he considered
that it would be incongruous to make a triumphal entry into
the capital of the kingdom when he had so lately been in arms
against the Sovereign.</p>

<p class='c012'>No sooner had he arrived than Condé made him overtures
and propositions of all kinds, and did all in his power to
induce the Marshal to enter into his political views, which
were of a most ambitious character. Turenne answered him
firmly. He was now perfectly satisfied, he said, and he only
required, from the gratitude of Condé, that the troops who
had fought in his behalf should have good and healthy quarters
for the winter; for he never forgot to plead the cause of his
soldiers. The brothers Condé and Conti were soon again
at issue with the Court, and engaged in seditious warfare,
while Cardinal Mazarin re-entered France at the head of
an armed force, upon which the Duke of Orleans once more
revolted from his allegiance. Turenne joined the King and
Queen at Saumur, where he was offered (and did not refuse,
as many in his place would have done) the command of the
army, in conjunction with a Marshal of very short standing,
D’Hocquincourt. One of the Vicomte’s most daring exploits
took place at Gergeau, then in possession of the rebel forces,
the taking of which was owing to his own personal skill and
courage, and was reckoned so important, that, on his return,
the Queen, in the presence of the assembled Court, acknowledged
that he had saved the Monarchy! Every tongue was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>loud in his praise; and yet, in speaking of the matter in a letter
to his sister, the only allusion he makes to the whole affair is in
these words: ‘Il s’est passé quelque chose à Gergeau qui n’est
pas de grande considération.’ Later on, when the Prince de
Condé was approaching Gien (where the King held Court)
with rapid strides, after gaining considerable advantages over
the Marshal D’Hocquincourt, Turenne made head against
him with a force vastly inferior in numbers.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a moment of imminent peril for the Court:
Cardinal Mazarin, who had once more joined the King and
Queen, watched the movements of the two armies with
great anxiety, constantly despatching couriers to learn the last
tidings; but Anne of Austria manifested her usual calm,
‘tranquille à sa toilette et à son dîner elle ne donnoit aucune
marque de crainte, quoique on avoit déjà commencé à
défendre son appartement.’</p>

<p class='c012'>Then came the welcome news that Turenne was victorious,
and the Prince de Condé in retreat. Another enthusiastic welcome
awaited the Vicomte, and again the Queen thanked him
for having once more replaced the crown on the head of her son.</p>

<p class='c012'>Cardinal Mazarin wrote an elaborate account of the proceedings
of the memorable day, in which he blamed the
Marshal D’Hocquincourt for having withstood the advice of his
noble colleague; but the generous-hearted Turenne insisted on
the passage being erased, ‘for,’ said he, ‘I am most unwilling
that any fresh mortification should be heaped on the man
who was already sufficiently distressed by several failures.’</p>

<p class='c012'>Henrietta, Queen of England, was now residing in France,
where she had taken refuge during the Protectorate, and was
joined by her sons, King Charles and James, Duke of York,
who, in those early days of his career, was a soldier at heart. He
had a profound admiration for Marshal Turenne, whose camp
he joined, and was present at many of the engagements which
took place at that time between the Royal and the rebel army,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Turenne always treating the exiled Prince with the utmost
consideration and kindness; and the Duke of York was
more than once employed as a mediator between the opposing
armies. Turenne pursued the Prince de Condé on his march
towards Paris, coming up with him in the Faubourg St.
Antoine, close to the capital. The Cardinal was so persistent
in his desire that Turenne should here attack Monsieur
le Prince, and that the Royal troops should commence the
attack, that he overruled the Marshal’s wish to await the
arrival of reinforcements. And so it chanced that, from a
neighbouring height, as from an amphitheatre, the King, his
Minister, and the whole Court, became spectators of one of
the bloodiest encounters that ever cursed a civil war.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘Jamais,’ says the biographer of Turenne, ‘action ne fut
disputée avec une valeur plus continuée, et plus opiniâtre. Les
deux généraux, tout couverts de sang, et toujours exposés aux
feux des mousquetaires, qui tiroient de maison à droite et à
gauche, combattirent souvent vis à vis l’un d’autre, à la portée
du pistolet. La fureur martiale de l’un, et le sangfroid de
l’autre, faisoient un contraste, dont le spectacle excitoit
l’admiration et la terreur.’</p>

<p class='c012'>After many fluctuations on one part and the other, the
Prince de Condé’s army was hemmed in, and must have been
cut to pieces had not the Parisians, seeing his danger, opened
the gates, and received the rebels within their walls, while the
cannon began playing on the Royal army, by command of
the King’s own cousin, Mademoiselle de Montpensier. So
hot was the fire, and so close the quarters, that Turenne was
obliged to abandon his desire of pursuing the enemy within
the walls. Disorder and tumult reigned in Paris, and a
terrible massacre took place at the Hôtel de Ville.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Court, by the Marshal’s advice, repaired to Pontoise,
and he himself to Compiègne; and it was chiefly through
his instrumentality that the Spanish troops were at length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>obliged to evacuate France, and retreat to Flanders. A sad
affliction was in store for the hero about this time, in the
death of his brother, the Duc de Bouillon, to whom he was
fondly attached. But he was not a man to allow sorrow to
interfere with duty. The ill feeling that was still rife against
the Cardinal Minister continued to be used as a pretext for
revolt and rebellion of all kinds. Turenne went in person
one day, and had a long and confidential conversation with
Mazarin, in which he pointed out, in the most emphatic
manner, that it was incumbent upon him (the Minister) to
make at least a temporary sacrifice for the good of the King,
his master, and the country in general. This, urged the
Marshal, would be effected by his absenting himself, for a
time at least. His arguments prevailed. Mazarin consented
to leave France, but in so doing he made his own conditions.
The King (who was directed to say he ‘only gave in to the
plan of dismissing his faithful Minister in order to pacify his
people’) received a paper from the Cardinal, in which directions
were drawn up for his own conduct; and His Majesty
was further instructed to place two of his Eminence’s most
devoted adherents at the head of affairs. After this was done,
Mazarin, strong in the conviction that the Queen would soon
recall him, took his way to Bouillon. But Condé and the
Duc de Lorraine still continued to harass the kingdom, and
peace seemed still far off; it was again by Turenne’s advice
that the Court was induced to proceed once more to Paris,
where the Marshal assured Louis that the Parisians, being
wearied by the unsettled state of affairs, would gladly
welcome him. Accordingly the Court set out; but as the
cortége approached the Bois de Boulogne, they were met by
a deputation, the members of which pointed out in the most
formidable colours the danger which his Majesty would
incur in entering Paris, where those arch-rebels, the Duke of
Orleans, and Mademoiselle de Montpensier, his daughter, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>caballing to incite the people against him. The royal coach
came to a stand-still, and Anne of Austria, with her accustomed
energy and promptness, made the ladies who were
inside alight, and summoning the Vicomte de Turenne, the
Marshals De Villeroi, Du Plessis, and others, she held an
open-air council. Every one, with the exception of Turenne,
was of opinion that they had better retrace their steps. The
noble soldier spoke, as he always did, with firmness and judgment.
He did not believe, he said, in the friendship of men
who could give such pusillanimous advice; that the return of
the Court would make them despicable in the eyes of all,
and would discourage the loyal, and give fresh impetus to the
plans of the disaffected. The Queen approved and seconded
him on every point, and the procession moved on once more.
The young King, at the head of his guards, rode in amid
loud cries of ‘Vive le Roi!’ and the acclamations of a huge
concourse that accompanied him to the gates of the Louvre.
The next day the Duke of Orleans and his daughter thought
it advisable to leave Paris, and amicable relations were
entered into between the King and his Parliament. ‘L’ordre
fût bientôt rétabli dans la ville, et le calme qui succeda fit
oublier les troubles de la Fronde.’ The Prince de Condé alone
refused to comply with the conditions of the amnesty which
was proclaimed, preferring, he said, to suffer any loss rather
than live in the same country with the Cardinal, whose return
was, of course, a matter of certainty; and he chose the
alternative of making a league with the Spaniards. Turenne
remained in Paris until he considered Louis to be safely reinstated
on the throne, and then he went again into the field at
a time of year when troops generally go into winter quarters.
On parting from the King, he promised to drive Condé
and his allies out of France before the expiration of the
winter; and he redeemed his pledge.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Prince de Condé was compelled to leave the country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and comparative peace was restored in the interior of the
kingdom; but peril, hardship, and scarcity still pursued the
Royal army, and exposed their noble commander to dreadful
straits, which were much aggravated by the jealousy of his
colleague, the Marshal de la Ferté. At the end of the
year 1652, the troops were ordered into winter quarters; and
in the commencement of the ensuing year the Vicomte de
Turenne espoused a lady, whose name, possessions, titles,
and good qualities engross a large space in the pages of the
Marshal’s biography. Her merits are best summed up in this
one sentence: ‘She was worthy to be the wife of the hero.’
Charlotte de Caumont was the daughter and heiress of
Armand Nompar de Caumont, Duc de la Force, Pair et
Maréchal de France,—beautiful, modest, rich, well educated,
and, in short, possessed of all those qualities which are
generally the attributes of a bride-elect.</p>

<p class='c012'>The newly-married pair were not long allowed to enjoy
their spell of happiness, for the month of June once more saw
the Marshal in the field, and the old warfare recommenced
between the King’s army and Condé and his Spanish allies.
The marches, counter-marches, attacks, sieges, and retreats
belong to the military annals of the time. Mazarin continued
to make fruitless overtures to Condé, who entangled himself
more and more with the Spaniards; but fell out with his other
ally, the Duke of Lorraine, whom he was instrumental in
causing to be arrested and imprisoned. The Prince de
Conti did not follow his brother’s example, and finding he
reaped no advantage from being at variance with the Court,
he became reconciled to the King and the Cardinal Minister,
whose niece, Anna Maria de Martinozzi, he shortly afterwards
married. Turenne’s attack on the Spanish lines and Condé’s
troops added so much to his military fame that complimentary
messages and letters from German princes and European
generals poured in on all sides. A characteristic trait is told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of the hero about this time, characteristic also of the spite
and jealousy of the Marshal de la Ferté. This general,
finding one of Turenne’s guards outside the camp, caused
him to be severely beaten. The man, covered with blood,
sought the presence of his commanding officer, and complained
of his usage.</p>

<p class='c012'>Turenne sent him back, under the escort of a lieutenant of
the Guards, with a message to De la Ferté, apologising for
any want of respect the man may have shown, as it must have
been something very reprehensible to cause so severe a
punishment. The message was given in the presence of the
whole staff of officers, who were acquainted with the real state
of the case, and De la Ferté was betrayed into exclaiming
aloud, ‘Cet homme sera-t-il toujours sage, et moi toujours
fou?’</p>

<p class='c012'>In the month of August the Marshals D’Hocquincourt and
De la Ferté joined the King, and the Vicomte de Turenne
remained in the undivided command of the army. Towards
the end of September he went back to Paris, where he was
again serviceable in negotiating affairs between the King and
the Parliament, but soon returned to active service. The
Frondeurs were dispersed or pardoned; the Duke of Orleans
reconciled to his brother; Cardinal de Retz, who had been
imprisoned and escaped, had sought refuge in Rome; but
Turenne still pursued his path of glory and of peril, gaining
fresh laurels, even when unsuccessful in the literal sense of
the word. His despatches and private communications were
invariably marked by that modesty which is the true attribute
of greatness. After the famous siege of Dunkirk, he wrote to
his wife: ‘Les ennemis sont venus, ils out été battus, Dieu
soit loué; j’ai été un peu fatigué toute la journée; je vous
donne le bon soir, et je vais me coucher.’</p>

<p class='c012'>This taking of Dunkirk was an affair of such importance,
that it is said Cardinal Mazarin wished to take the glory on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>himself of projecting and planning the enterprise; and it is
further stated that he endeavoured to bribe the great general
into bearing witness to the Minister’s share in the matter, by a
written document. It was wonderful that the Cardinal should
not by this time have learned better to understand the character
of the man with whom he had to deal. Turenne replied
that Mazarin might pride himself as much as he pleased
on his knowledge of military tactics, but for himself he would
never bear testimony to a falsehood.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the end of the year 1658 Turenne brought back his army
to France, and returned to Court, having routed the Spaniards,
taken twelve towns of importance, subdued large tracts of
country, and garrisoned the places he had annexed. The reverses
of the Spanish arms inclined Philip <span class='fss'>IV.</span> to listen to terms,
while Anne of Austria represented to the Cardinal that peace
would be a fit thank-offering to Heaven for the recovery of the
King, who had been dangerously ill. Mazarin himself was also
in favour of a treaty, as during all these campaigns he had
never quite abandoned a darling scheme for uniting the interests
of the two nations by the marriage of King Louis with Maria
Theresa, Infanta of Spain. The moment seemed propitious
in every way,—Cromwell was dead, and England treating with
her exiled King for his return. Both Charles and his brother,
the Duke of York, were personally attached to France, and the
latter, as we have seen, had served in the French army under
the great Turenne.</p>

<p class='c012'>In November 1659 the Treaty of the Pyrenees was
made, which had for its basis the marriage of Louis with
his cousin, Maria Theresa, and contained numerous conditions,
stipulations, exchanges of territory, and the like,
which were very advantageous to France. Cardinal Mazarin
was unsuccessful in his endeavours to make peace between
Spain and Portugal, which he desired; otherwise, matters were
arranged to his satisfaction, and the marriage fixed for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>spring or early summer of the ensuing year. Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span>,
anxious to bestow some mark of special favour on Marshal
Turenne, offered to revive in his honour the dormant title of
Grand Connétable, the highest dignity which was in the
power of the Crown to bestow. But the acceptance of the
office entailed a renunciation of the Protestant religion, and
Turenne was not the man to sacrifice his faith to his worldly
interest. The King, on hearing the decision, invented a new
title, ‘Henri de la Tour d’Auvergne, fût intitulé Maréchal
Général, des Camps, et des armées du Roi.’</p>

<p class='c012'>In the month of June, the Kings of France and Spain,
attended by a brilliant assemblage of princes, nobles, and
officers, met on the Ile des Faisans, formed by the river
Bidassoa, which separates the two kingdoms,—a small and
insignificant place, suddenly transformed into a theatre for
the display of the magnificence and luxury in which the Courts
of both nations delighted. The young King of France, in the
flower of his age, handsome in form and features, and majestic
in bearing, the venerable King Philip <span class='fss'>IV.</span>, and Anne of
Austria, sumptuous in dress and imposing in manner. The
brother and sister, who had not met for nearly half a century,
fell on each other’s neck and shed tears of joy, though the
tender affection thus manifested had not prevented them from
engaging for so long a space of time in bloody warfare. Perhaps
the most distinguished member of the French King’s Court
was the Marshal Turenne, who kept as much as was possible
in the background, until singled out by the King of Spain,
who desired that he should be presented. Gazing with eager
scrutiny at the world-renowned soldier, ‘That is the man,’
he said, ‘who has caused me so many sleepless nights.’
The Treaty of the Pyrenees produced a temporary lull in
European hostilities; but Spain and Portugal were still at
issue, and France involved in their quarrels.</p>

<p class='c012'>In March 1661 died Cardinal Mazarin, who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Prime Minister for sixteen years, and the King assumed the
reins of government, retaining the heads of the Administration
in office, but constantly consulting his faithful friend, the
Vicomte, on matters political as well as military; and war
being declared between England and Holland, France sided
with the latter country. The Vicomtesse de Turenne died
the same year, to the great sorrow of her husband. His
biographer speaks of the noble lady in high terms, ‘casting but
one slur on her memory,—she clung to the prejudices of her
childhood, even though she had the advantage of lengthened
conferences with the most eminent divines of the Church of
Rome;’ <i>Anglicè</i>, she had remained steadfast in the Protestant
faith.</p>

<p class='c012'>Anne of Austria was no sooner dead than Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span>
once more declared war with Spain and the Emperor of
Germany, at the same time, strengthening himself by fresh
alliances with England, Holland, Sweden, and other powers.
He then announced to Turenne his intention to place himself
at the head of his army, and learn the art of war under
the auspices of that great commander. The rapid successful
advances of the French arms alarmed both England and
Holland, and caused them to form a defensive league with
Sweden, under the name of The Triple Alliance, the object
of which was to arrest the encroachments of France.</p>

<p class='c012'>A treaty between Spain and Portugal, by which the
independence of the last-named country was established,
was shortly followed by the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, which
compelled Louis to come to terms with Spain. The enumeration
of these diplomatic relations is essential to the details
of our biography.</p>

<p class='c012'>Turenne had now leisure, although it did not last long,
to turn his thoughts seriously to a subject which for some
time past had occupied his mind. He had often, in his
letters to his wife, expressed doubts and scruples on points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>of religious faith, and it is supposed that he would have
embraced the Roman Catholic creed earlier, had he not feared,
by so doing, to afflict and distress the wife whom he loved
so dearly. Be this as it may, he now saw and conferred
with the eloquent and learned Abbé de Bossuet, afterwards
Bishop of Meaux, and the result was that he abjured the
faith for which his house had fought and bled, and was
received into the Church of Rome. Unable as we are to
join in the exultation of the Marshal’s biographer on this
point, we still coincide with him in the belief that no hope of
worldly advancement had any part in Turenne’s change of
creed. We are told that he became from that time more
rigid in his morals, more circumspect in his life, and, at all
events, the answer he made to his confessor deserves to be
recorded. The priest asked him whether he had fallen back
into a fault, of which he had repented. ‘Je n’ai jamais
manqué de parole aux hommes, en manquerais-je à Dieu?’</p>

<p class='c012'>He went very little into society, and even showed an
inclination towards a monastic life, having a great desire to
give himself up to the study of theology; but the King, alarmed
at the prospect of losing services invaluable to the State,
interfered to prevent him from taking this step. Turenne now
resided in Paris, surrounded by a small circle of friends,
keeping a frugal table, ‘where the conversation was far more
remarkable than the fare.’</p>

<p class='c012'>About this time occurred an episode in his life which
occasioned him lasting regret. Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span>, feeling himself
bound and crippled by the conditions of the Triple Alliance,
consulted with his Prime Minister Louvois, and his
faithful friend the Vicomte de Turenne, on the possibility
of detaching the King of England from his share in the
Treaty. Turenne was a constant visitor at the Court of the
Duchess of Orleans, sister of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>, and he now turned his
thoughts towards influencing that Princess to persuade her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>brother to secede from the Alliance. Now Madame had a
young and very beautiful lady-in-waiting, the Marquise de
Coëtquen, daughter of the Duke of Rohan-Chabot, who was
a great favourite with her royal mistress. Turenne thought it
would serve his purpose to win the confidence of the Duchess
through the medium of her lady, and, feeling a security in the
disparity of years, paid Madame de Coëtquen the most marked
attention; while she, on her part, seemed to ignore the
difference of age, being highly flattered by the devotion of so
great a personage. A hero’s heart is proverbially susceptible
(we have already seen that Turenne was not exempt from such
amiable weaknesses); and he was accepted as a lover. The
two were inseparable, and the <i>liaison</i> attracted the attention
of the Duke of Orleans. Jealous of his wife’s favour at Court,
he imagined that some political intrigue was being carried on,
in which the Marquise and the Marshal were implicated.
He accordingly directed his favourite, the fascinating Chevalier
de Lorraine, to devote himself to Madame de Coëtquen, and
extract the secret from her. In order to please her younger
adorer, the lady wrung from the Marshal the details of the King’s
conversation, which she immediately imparted to the Chevalier.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Duke of Orleans in a fury sought the Royal presence,
and complained to the King that every one was trusted with
State secrets except himself; but that he had ascertained without
doubt that steps were being taken to annul the Triple
Alliance.</p>

<p class='c012'>The King, indignant at the betrayal of his confidence,
summoned Turenne to his presence, and burst into violent
complaints against Louvois, ‘For,’ said his Majesty, ‘you and
he were the only persons to whom I mentioned the subject.’
The Minister had always shown himself inimical to Turenne,
and never lost an opportunity of endeavouring to lower or
supplant him in the Royal favour, a circumstance of which the
Marshal was well aware; but he was in no way tempted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>swerve from his unwavering veracity. He exonerated the
Minister, by taking the whole blame on himself, and confessed
that, in a moment of weakness, he had divulged the King’s
secret to Madame de Coëtquen.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘A fellow-feeling makes one (sometimes) wondrous kind:’
the King, perhaps reflecting he might have acted in the same
manner in a similar position, forgave his friend; but Turenne
never forgave himself or the lady, whom he never saw again.
For himself, many years afterwards, when the Chevalier de
Lorraine jestingly inquired some particulars of the affair, the
Vicomte replied, ‘Commençons par éteindre les bougies.’</p>

<p class='c012'>The Duchess of Orleans, as is well known, did undertake
the mission to her brother, in which she was successful; and
shortly after her return to France, she retired to St. Cloud,
accompanied by several nobles; among others the Vicomte
de Turenne and the Duc de la Rochefoucauld. Her sudden
and mysterious death, generally believed to be the effect of
poison, in the bloom of life and beauty, threw a deep gloom
over the whole nation. Turenne, in particular, was profoundly
affected by the event, and again contemplated the
idea of retirement from the world; but France could not spare
him, and he was soon once more in the field, gaining fresh
laurels. His last campaign was the crowning-point in his
glory, and in the beginning of the year 1675 he returned
to Versailles, his whole route one triumphal procession,
flowers strewing his path, acclamations and blessings attending
him wherever he appeared. In the whole of France no
enemy was left, with the exception of such as were prisoners;
on his arrival at Versailles, he was embraced by the King,
and congratulated and made much of by all classes.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the early summer of 1675, Turenne, at the head of the
French army, and the Count de Montecuculi, in command
of the Imperialists, were pitted against each other. Few
periods in European history could have been richer in names
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of distinguished military commanders,—the King of France
himself, the Prince of Orange, the Prince de Condé, the
Elector of Brandenburg, the Swedish General Wrangel, and
above all, the two heroes, Marshal Turenne and the Count
de Montecuculi, who now disputed with each other the passage
of the Rhine. A paragraph in the life of the former,
from which we have so freely quoted, in speaking of the rival
generals, draws so good a parallel that we are tempted to
transcribe it verbatim:—</p>

<p class='c012'>‘Les yeux de toute l’Europe furent fixés sur ces deux
grands capitaines, tous deux à peu près du même âge, qui
avoient eu la même éducation, formés par deux oncles rivaux,
le Prince Maurice, et le Comte Ernest, ils avoient porté
le mousquet, avant que de parvenir à aucune grade, et acquis
par cinquante années de combats une expérience consommée
dans toutes les parties de l’art militaire. L’un et l’autre
avoit reçu du ciel un esprit supérieur, un jugement solide,
et un sangfroid, qui dans un général n’est pas moins nécessaire,
que la prévoyance et la valeur. Capitaines par étude, ils
combattoient par principes, et ne donnoient presque rien à la
fortune. Adorés du soldat, l’amour pour le général plutôt que
l’obéissance due au souverain, paroissoit animer l’une et l’autre
armée. Ces deux généraux se connoissoient, s’estimoient, et
se craignoient mutuellement, ni l’un ni l’autre n’osoit attendre
la victoire des fautes de son ennemi, il falloit l’emporter, à
force de génie, et de science militaire.’</p>

<p class='c012'>This last campaign was pronounced by an unquestionable
authority to be the <i>chef d’œuvre</i> alike of Turenne and Montecuculi.</p>

<p class='c012'>Their marches, countermarches, attacks and retreats, were
worthy of themselves and of each other; but Turenne was
stronger and more active than his rival, who often suffered
from gout, which prevented his being as much on horseback
as he desired.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>On the 27th of July the two armies drew up in order of
battle not far from the village of Salzbach, and the position
seemed so advantageous for the French troops that Turenne,
contrary to his custom, expressed himself most confidently as to
the result. That morning, after hearing Mass and partaking
of the Holy Communion, the Marshal mounted his horse and
carefully reconnoitred the ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘C’en est fait, je les tiens,’ he said to some by-standing
officers. ‘Ils ne pourroient plus m’échapper; je vais recueillir
les fruits d’une si pénible campagne.’ The hero was indeed
about to rest from his labours, but not in the manner he
anticipated. Observing a movement in the enemy’s infantry,
which he imagined denoted an intention to retreat, he alighted
from his charger, and sat down to rest under a large tree and
eat his breakfast; after which he again mounted, and rode up
a small eminence, forbidding his officers to follow him, and
speaking with well-simulated severity to his nephew, the Duc
d’Elbeuf, ‘Pray do not stick so close to me,’ he said; ‘you
will cause me to be recognised.’ The youth’s life was very
dear to him. The English general, Hamilton, now came up,
and begged him not to ‘ride up there, for they are firing in
that direction.’ Turenne smiled, and said, ‘Oh, I must not be
killed to-day,’ and passed on his way. He then met General
St. Hilaire, who asked his opinion of the spot at which he had
stationed a battery. Turenne reined back his horse a few
paces in order to judge, when a stray shot shattered St.
Hilaire’s arm, and lodged in the middle of the Marshal’s
body. His favourite charger, ‘La Pie,’ wheeled round, and
galloped back to the point where he had left his company,
then, halting suddenly, the lifeless body of Henri de la Tour
d’Auvergne fell into the arms of his weeping soldiers. Twice
he opened his eyes and moved his lips, but never spoke again;
while St. Hilaire thus addressed his son, who was lamenting
over his father’s sufferings: ‘Keep your tears,’ he said, ‘for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the great man whom we have this day lost.’ The consternation
of the spectators of this sad scene was indescribable; no
one appeared to have retained his presence of mind. Hamilton
ordered a cloak to be thrown over the body, and desired
that the Marshal’s death should be kept secret as long as
possible, foreseeing the panic which would ensue in the
French army. But the news soon spread, and infused fresh
vigour into the enemy’s troops. The gallant and generous
Montecuculi, on hearing his great rival was no more, was
much affected, and uttered these memorable words (no insignificant
or inappropriate epitaph), ‘Il est mort! un homme
qui faisoit honneur à l’homme.’ The intelligence spread
from rank to rank, and was at first received in dead silence,
broken after a few moments by sobs, and the loud cry, ‘Our
father is dead, and we are lost!’ Then they rushed in crowds
to gaze on his dead body, and called on their officers to lead
them on to revenge his death. But no one seemed willing to
take the command. There was delay and deliberation, till
the soldiers again burst forth angrily, ‘Lâchez la Pie, elle
nous conduira.’</p>

<p class='c012'>The Marshal’s death changed and reversed the plans of
both armies. The French began to retire, the Imperialists to
advance, and on the 29th a desperate battle took place, with
considerable loss on both sides, after which the French crossed
the Rhine in retreat. So strong was their belief, even to
superstition, in the ruling star of Turenne, that some soldiers
were overheard to say, ‘If our father had been alive we should
not have been wounded.’</p>

<p class='c012'>On their march to Paris, the troops paid funeral honours to
their beloved commander,—his nephews and brother officers
with crape-bound arms, the soldiers with muskets reversed,
the voice of the officiating priest often inaudible from the
sobs and lamentations of the mourners. The King was
deeply affected, as we learn from Madame de Sévigné’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>touching letter to her daughter, and all the more so, that he
received a despatch from the Marshal, full of the most sanguine
anticipations of coming victory simultaneously with the
account of his death. So deep a sensation was produced at
Court, that, marvellous to relate, a projected fête that was to
have taken place at Versailles was postponed, and a courtier
was on the point of fainting!</p>

<p class='c012'>When the hero’s body reached Paris, the King ordered it
to be placed in the Chapel of St. Denis, usually allotted to the
Royal family. It was not only in the French capital that people
of all classes came to swell the funeral procession, artisans
leaving their work unfinished for that purpose, but all the way
along the road from the Rhine country, marks of honour and
respect were paid, alike by friend and foe. The Court, the
Parliament, the University, the Municipality, all attended
the Marshal’s funeral, and the most celebrated divines vied
with one another in eulogising him from the pulpit. Père
Mascaron, in his funeral oration, says, ‘Au milieu du tumulte
et du bruit des armes, les sentimens du chrétien, accompagnoient,
animoient, et perfectionnoient, en lui, ceux du heros.’</p>

<p class='c012'>In emergencies his decisions were prompt; where the matter
did not press he took time to consider. His military skill needs
no encomium; to that his whole life bore testimony. His
early education had taught him to revere discipline, and he
consequently submitted willingly to those in authority, except—as
in the case of the Prime Minister Louvois, who presumed
to dictate to him on military tactics—when they interfered
in matters with which they were not competent to deal. The
love his soldiers bore him bordered upon worship, and he
returned their affection. Although a strict disciplinarian, he
always tempered justice with mercy; he shared the hardships
of the men, and ministered to their comforts, frequently paying
out of his own privy purse the arrears which he could not
wring from the Government. His compassion to his prisoners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>made him esteemed among his enemies; and he was most
severe in the prohibition of pillage. In one of his campaigns
(we allude to it with deep regret), his own troops,
driven to terrible straits in the matter of provisions, and
burning with the desire to take reprisals for cruelties practised
on their countrymen, Turenne not only sanctioned, but
enforced, devastation and destruction in the Palatinate; so
much so, that the Elector wrote him a furious letter, terminating
with a challenge. His love of truth was proverbial; his simple
word outweighed the oaths of other men, and his own memoirs
vouch for his modesty of speech. When he alluded to a defeat,
he used to say, ‘The battle I lost;’ when to a victory, ‘The
battle we gained.’ He was moral and religious; he hated excess
of any kind, and, with the exception of occasional attacks of
gout, his health was good to the end. In appearance, Turenne
was about the middle height, broad shoulders, bushy eyebrows,
and rather heavy features; simple but decent in dress.</p>

<p class='c012'>In youth he had loved athletic exercises and military studies
too well to give his thoughts to other branches of learning; but
as years passed on, he became aware how necessary is general
knowledge to a commander, and he gave his mind to the
study of history, geography, languages, etc. He was not carried
away by impulse, but calm in adversity as in prosperity,
unmoved by abuse or praise, he went like an arrow straight
to the mark. His pride was that of birth; his glory was in
the honour of his house, never in his own. He treated his
brother as a sovereign, and even yielded the <i>pas</i> to his nephew,
while he, the latter, was still a child.</p>

<p class='c012'>Numerous anecdotes are told of Turenne, which redound
to his advantage. An officer, wishing to ingratiate himself
with the general, showed him a way to obtain a large sum of
money, and ‘no one be the wiser.’ ‘Thank you,’ said Turenne
coldly; ‘I have had plenty of such chances before now, without
taking advantage of them.’</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Another time, the inhabitants of a certain town came to
offer him a considerable bribe if he would not pass through
their district. ‘Keep your money,’ was the reply; ‘you do
not lie in my line of march.’</p>

<p class='c012'>Walking one evening on the ramparts of a town, he was
attacked by several robbers, who insisted on his giving them
a ring he habitually wore. The Marshal calmly began to
parley with them. ‘See, my friends,’ he said, ‘we will come to
terms. If you will leave me in possession of that trinket, I
will promise you a hundred louis, which is considerably above
its value. I have not the money on my person, but if one of
you will come and claim it to-morrow, I will guarantee your
safety.’</p>

<p class='c012'>No one ever doubted the Marshal’s given word. The
next morning, surrounded by his staff, Turenne received the
robbers’ messenger, and giving him the money, dismissed him
with courtesy, much to the surprise and amusement of his
officers, when made acquainted with the facts of the case.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day a servant of his household, coming behind him so
quickly as not to recognise the Marshal, dealt him a heavy
blow; overcome with confusion, the man apologised in the
humblest terms, offering as an excuse that he thought it
was a fellow-servant. ‘Well,’ said his master, smiling good-naturedly,
though still smarting from the blow, ‘even if it had
been George, you need not have hit so hard.’</p>

<p class='c012'>Turenne was mourned, not only by his countrymen and
his allies, but his very enemies showed the greatest respect for
his memory. The spot where he fell was left untouched, and
the tree under which he had reposed shortly before his death
was held sacred by the peasants, and pointed out by them to
passers-by. Neither did it perish through decay, but was
carried off branch by branch as trophies, by soldiers of all
nations. In 1781 the Cardinal de Rohan erected a monument
to his memory at Salzbach, which was repaired by Moreau
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>in 1801, and about thirty years afterwards a large pyramid of
granite was raised on the spot.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many and strange were the vicissitudes which befell the
body of this great man. It was placed (as we have said)
in the Royal Chapel of St. Denis, by order of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span>,
and when the tombs of the royal family were desecrated in
the Revolution of 1793, Turenne’s embalmed body was so
well preserved as to be an object of desire to the owner of a
Museum of Natural History. He gained permission to place
it there, and it was exhibited among the skeletons and fossils
of animals for some time, and then removed to an antiquarian
museum for the edification of its members. Buonaparte, who
had a profound admiration for the memory of the great soldier,
caused the remains to be carried with much solemnity to the
Church of the Invalides, and there deposited, while the
Marshal’s heart, which had been placed in the Abbey of
Cluny, was restored to his family.</p>

<p class='c012'>This splendid picture is said to be the only equestrian
portrait extant by Rembrandt. Its date has been given
1649-1650, when it is said in a Life of the painter that
Turenne passed a month in Holland, and this picture was
most probably painted. It was bought in 1740 by the Earl
of Grantham (father-in-law to the second Earl Cowper) from
a private collection at Amsterdam.</p>

HE was the son of a tailor in Florence; and this
trade, which is so often (for one reason or
another) spoken of derisively in England,
has surely gained to Italian ears a species
of glorification, from the sobriquet attached
to this illustrious painter. When only seven
years old, the little Andrea was taken from the school where
he received instruction in reading and writing, and placed
with a goldsmith in the city. Even at that tender age his
predilection for drawing, and even designing, showed itself,
and, in like manner, his aversion to handling the mechanical
instruments used in the handicraft. Indeed, the boy’s drawings
were so clever as to attract the attention of one Gian Barile, a
Florentine painter; so much so, that he did not rest until he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>had secured Andrea for his own studio; and as old Vasari
quaintly says, ‘No sooner did the boy begin to exercise himself
in the art of painting than he acknowledged that Nature
had created him for that employment.’ In a very short space
of time, Andrea, or Del Sarto, as he was called, produced such
excellent pieces of colour as to excite the admiration of
his master and all the artists in Florence, more especially
Piero Cosimo, whose works were much esteemed in the
city, and who proceeded to engage Andrea as his pupil.
Nothing could be more diligent than the young man
proved himself, studying and copying the cartoons of Michel
Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc., which were allotted the
scholars as models; and he surpassed all his fellow-workers
in the studio and academy, with one of whom, Francia
Bigio, he soon formed an intimate friendship. One day,
working, as was their custom, side by side, the two young
men began to compare notes, with respect to the manner
in which they were treated by their respective masters;
they had each complaints to make; they were each discontented
with their lot. After some little discussion, they
resolved to set up house, or rather to take a room, together,
which they accordingly did, in the Piazza del Grano. Here
they laboured diligently, painting chiefly sacred subjects for
galleries, churches, etc., both in oil and in fresco. There was at
that time a confraternity, ‘Detto del Scalzo,’ whose meetings
were held in the Via Larga. They were formed for the most
part of the artificers of the city, but included men of all classes,
who met for charitable and religious purposes; although not
essentially a religious order, they took the name of The Scalzo,
from the fact that when they met in prayer, or to walk in procession,
they went barefoot. This company was most
desirous that Andrea del Sarto should adorn the walls of their
court with paintings from the life of their patron saint, St.
John the Baptist. The company was not very wealthy, neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>was our painter grasping, whatever may have been said of
him later on, when subjected to a bad influence. He cheerfully
undertook the work for a small remuneration, and reaped
his reward, for these frescoes added so considerably to his fame
that innumerable orders came in from all sides. He now
moved to better quarters (in company with Francia Bigio),
from the Piazza del Grano to a house situated in the neighbourhood
of the Annunziata, where he made acquaintance
with Jacopo Tatti, better known as the celebrated Sansovino,
in whose society and conversation Andrea took so much
delight that the two young enthusiasts in art became almost
inseparable. Del Sarto was now gaining a good income, and
might have been happy in the company of his friends, and the
pursuit of his beloved art, but for a false step which involved
his whole life in ruin and disaster. In the Via San Gallo
lived a certain hatter, who had married Lucrezia Bartolommeo
de Fede, the daughter of indigent and ill-conditioned parents.
She was a young woman of exceeding beauty, violent and arrogant
by nature, exercising a tyrannical influence over her many
admirers, of whom Andrea was one of the most infatuated.
Unfortunately for our painter, the husband died suddenly,
and nothing would content Del Sarto but he would immediately
espouse his inamorata. From the very beginning of
their married life she possessed such a mastery over him that
he was her slave in everything, and spent all his time and
money on her and her relations, neglecting, in consequence,
his own aged parents, whom he had hitherto supported. His
friends shunned his society, his servants quitted his service, so
ungenial and unamiable was the behaviour of Lucrezia.</p>

<p class='c012'>The fame of Del Sarto’s great talent had reached the
ears of Francis <span class='fss'>I.</span>, King of France, who gave him orders for
pictures, and invited him to Paris—a proposition which
smiled upon Andrea; but he was detained in Florence to
assist in the splendid decorations of the city, in which all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the painters, sculptors, and architects were employed, to
celebrate the triumphal entry of Pope Leo <span class='fss'>X.</span>, of the house
of Medici; and the beautiful works of Andrea on this
occasion inspired his Holiness with unqualified admiration.
The unworthy woman to whom he was united interfered with
his advancement in every way; although unable to throw off
the spell by which she bound him, he began to find her
tyranny irksome, and he listened to the advice of a friend,
who bade him separate from her for a season, and assert
his independence. This was in 1518, when Francis <span class='fss'>I.</span>,
having renewed his invitation to our painter to enter his
service, Del Sarto gladly accepted the money which had been
sent him for the journey, and proceeded to Paris, where the
King received him with every mark of distinction, and gave him
a settled salary, together with gifts and garments of most costly
description. Caressed and admired by the monarch and his
whole Court, Andrea set to work in high spirits, and began, as
it were, a new life. Amongst other pictures, he painted one of
the King’s infant son, in rich swaddling-clothes, which so
delighted Francis that he gave the artist on the spot three
hundred dollars. This was a happy period in Andrea’s life;
he painted numerous portraits and historical and sacred pictures
for the King and his courtiers, and was much esteemed
by all. These halcyon days were not destined to be of long
duration. He was occupied in finishing a St. Jerome for the
Queen-Mother when he received a letter from his evil genius; in
this epistle Lucrezia appealed to his affection, his compassion,
his duty as a husband, coaxing, menacing, exciting his easily
roused feelings, and working on them so strongly as to make
him seek the Royal presence and ask leave of absence, promising
to return shortly with his wife, and to bring with him some
fine works of painting and sculpture. He pledged his solemn
word to this effect, and the generous-hearted King furnished
him with fresh funds for the journey and the commission.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>On his arrival in Florence, once more under the sway of
his unworthy wife, Andrea gave in to her every wish, and with
the money that he had made, and, it is also to be feared, the
sums intrusted to him by the French King, he built a house,
and lavished large sums on Lucrezia and her family, still to the
detriment of his own parents. When the time of his leave had
expired, he made a feeble attempt to return to his duty, but
he could not withstand the prayers, tears, and expostulations
of his wife, and thus broke his plighted word, and relinquished
his hopes of honourable advancement in France. The King,
exasperated at such conduct, expressed himself in most indignant
terms, and vowed he would never harbour another
painter from Florence. Thus was Andrea hurled from a high
and honourable estate by the wicked woman he had made his
wife,—the model for almost every picture he painted, sacred
or secular, and whose lineaments were so vividly impressed on
his memory that he often involuntarily reproduced them on
canvas.</p>

<p class='c012'>Leo <span class='fss'>X.</span> had given a commission for the ornamentation
and decoration of the dome of the great hall at Poggi
a Cajano, one of the Medicean villas near Florence, to be
executed in stucco and frescoes by the best Florentine artists,
and Andrea’s contribution on that occasion is described in
glowing terms by his admirer Vasari. It represented Cæsar
receiving the present of innumerable animals of every description,
the delineation of which, in their truth and variety, could
not be surpassed. He interspersed the birds and beasts with
Oriental natives in picturesque costume, and we quote Vasari’s
words, ‘Altre belle fantasie, lavorate in fresco divinissimamente.’
The choice of this subject was supposed to convey
an allusion to the menagerie of animals which had been sent
to Lorenzo the Magnificent some years before by an Eastern
potentate.</p>

<p class='c012'>The works at Poggi a Cajano were stopped in consequence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of the death of Pope Leo, and Andrea’s fresco was afterwards
finished by Bronzino. He began bitterly to repent
his ingratitude to the French King, and if he had had the
slightest hope of obtaining pardon, he would have risked
going to Paris. Several times he resolved to send some of
his best pictures to the French capital, with the chance of
their meeting the King’s eye, but the idea was relinquished.
In 1523 the beautiful city of Florence and its environs were
visited by the plague, which caused a terrible mortality; but
in that country everything that happens seems to tend to
picturesque and poetical results, and all the world knows how
Boccaccio glorified that affliction by the production of his
<i>Decameron</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>Andrea, with his wife and daughter-in-law, her sister, and
a child, desirous of escaping from the infected neighbourhood,
and at the same time to continue his labours, gladly accepted
an order from the nuns of San Pier de Luco, of the Order
of Camaldoli, to paint for them a Pieta in their convent
at Mugello. In consequence of these holy women caressing
and making much of the painter, his wife, and the whole
‘troop,’ he determined to stay on for some time in that place,
and set himself to work with great zeal and delight. Vasari’s
descriptions of the beauty and pathos of these paintings are
most eloquent in their old-world style of expression; we
regret we have no space for extracts. On his return to
Florence, Del Sarto resumed his labours, and executed orders
without number, chiefly on sacred subjects. He was as
skilful in his copying as in his original paintings, and a
curious anecdote is given in illustration of this fact.</p>

<p class='c012'>Frederick, the second Duke of Mantua, in his passage
through Florence to do homage to Pope Clement <span class='fss'>VII.</span>, saw
the celebrated portrait of Pope Leo <span class='fss'>X.</span>, with two Cardinals, the
work of the immortal Raphael d’Urbino, with which he was
so much struck, as to excite in him an inordinate desire to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>possess that splendid picture; and he made so urgent a
request to his Holiness that Clement knew not how to refuse
him, but sent Ottaviano de Medici, his kinsman, an order to
send the painting to Mantua.</p>

<p class='c012'>This command was received with dismay at Florence,—for
was not that portrait one of the glories of the city? In this
strait Ottaviano sent for Andrea, took counsel with him,
and it was arranged between them that Del Sarto should
make an exact copy of this <i>capo d’ opera</i> of Raphael, which
he executed with such skill in every respect,—not only as
regarded the excellence of the drawing and colouring, but also
the reproduction of certain little marks and after-touches and
other details,—so much so that, when completed, Ottaviano
himself confessed he could scarcely detect the original. The
two conspirators were delighted with the success of their
scheme, and the Duke was in like manner delighted with the
picture when it was unpacked at Mantua. Giulio Romano,
Raphael’s disciple and own familiar friend, who was there at
the time, never doubted its authenticity for a moment. But
there was a small bird of the air that carried the matter, and
this was young Giorgio Vasari, who had been brought up in
the household of the Medici, and who, when asked by Giulio
Romano if he did not think the portrait in question a splendid
work of Raphael, replied that it was indeed splendid,
although not the work of Raphael, but of Andrea del Sarto.
‘As if it were likely,’ said Giulio, ‘that I should not recognise
the painting! Why, I can see the very touches I myself
added to it.’ ‘For all that,’ persisted the youth, ‘this picture
is from the hands of Del Sarto, and I saw him working at it
with my own eyes; and I will prove it to you. If you will look
at the back, you will see a mark which shows that it was
executed in Florence.’ Giulio Romano turned the picture,
and finding the mark which confirmed Vasari’s words, he
could only shrug his shoulders and acknowledge the wonderful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>talent of the painter, who had made a perfect facsimile of one
of Raphael’s masterpieces.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet one more anecdote, to illustrate the admiration which
Andrea’s works inspired, and we have done.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the siege of Florence, in 1529, the infuriated soldiery
were sacking the town, especially the sacred buildings. They
had already destroyed the church and belfry of San Salvi, and
rushing into the convent, undisciplined as they were, their
attention was arrested by the fresco of Andrea del Sarto’s Last
Supper, by some esteemed the rival of Leonardo’s Cenacolo
at Milan. This divine painting had such an effect on the
minds of those rude men, excited as they were, that, after
gazing on it for a short time in reverence, they left the room
in silence, thus sparing that incomparable work for the wonder
and reverence of upwards of three centuries. After the siege
was over, Andrea still cherished a hope of some day regaining
the favour of Francis <span class='fss'>I.</span>, and kept revolving in his mind
how to do so, when he was taken suddenly ill. Some soldiers
who had returned to Florence were said to have brought back
the plague, and food was supposed to have become infected.
Whether or not Andrea’s sickness were of this nature, it is
certain he took to his bed, and gave himself up for lost. His
worthless wife fled in terror, leaving him to die alone, without
help or comfort. The brethren Del Scalzo, for whom he had
worked so assiduously, gave him burial, though with great
haste and little ceremony, and a monument was raised to him
in the Annunziata by one of his pupils, with a Latin epitaph,
most eulogistic. Lucrezia del Fede survived Andrea many
years, and received payment after his death for the works of
that husband whose life she had helped to make miserable.
Her death took place in 1570.</p>

SON of Ser Giovanni Simone, da Castello di
San Giovanni, in Val d’Arno. From his
earliest years he cared for nothing but art.
Nature designed him for a painter, and no
other amusement or occupation had any
charms for Tommaso. He cared not for
money, he did not study his appearance as is the way with
most youths, and from a certain recklessness and lack of
interest in his surroundings, he acquired for himself the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>epithet of Masaccio,—most assuredly not from any bad
quality that could be discovered in him, for he was goodness
itself. His masters were Masolino de Panicale in painting,
Ghiberti and Donatello in sculpture, and Brunelleschi in
perspective. Could the young aspirant have had more
illustrious teachers?</p>

<p class='c012'>He worked assiduously, and received many commissions,
chiefly for the decoration of churches, both in Florence and
Pisa, the excellence of which gained him the friendship and
patronage of Cosimo de Medici, who was always ready to
encourage merit in any branch, more especially in the fine
arts. When dark days fell on Florence, and Cosimo was
exiled, Masaccio determined to go to Rome and study the
antique. The Pope gave him many orders, and his paintings
in Santa Maria Maggiore gained him lasting fame, and called
forth enthusiastic expressions of admiration from Michel
Angelo many years later. Masaccio was very fond of introducing
portraits into his pictures and frescoes, and in this church
he painted Pope Martin and the Emperor Sigismund <span class='fss'>II.</span>
He was busied over the façade of San Giovanni, when, hearing
his friend Cosimo had been recalled to Florence, he lost
no time in joining him. Cosimo gave him orders innumerable,
and the facility with which Masaccio executed them was only
equalled by their excellence. The notice which was taken of
him in high places, and the superiority of his talents, caused
great jealousy among his fellow-artists, but he worked on. In
the church of the Carmine he painted a procession of citizens
repairing to the consecration of the sacred building, introducing
therein innumerable portraits, amongst others his
masters, Masolino, Brunelleschi, Donatello, etc.,—all marvellous,
says Vasari, in their truth and beauty. Later on, in a
painting of St. Peter paying tribute, he depicted his own
likeness, taken from the reflection in a looking-glass, which is
described as to the very life.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>He was attacked by sudden illness in the midst of his
successful career, under which he soon succumbed, and was
buried in the church of the Carmine without an epitaph on
the stone, but Annibal Caro wrote the following in later
years:—</p>

THE third son of Henry Percy, ninth Earl of
Northumberland, by Dorothy, daughter of
Walter Devereux, Earl of Sussex. Educated
at Christ Church, Oxford, under Robert
Hughes, the celebrated mathematician, and
in 1616 was one of the youthful Knights of
the Bath at the creation of Charles, Prince of Wales.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the accession of that Prince to the Throne, he was
called by writ to the House of Peers (his father being then
alive) as Baron Percy.</p>

<p class='c012'>He afterwards, as Privy Councillor, attended the King to
Scotland for his coronation, having by that time succeeded to
his father’s titles and estates.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>In 1636 he had the command of a noble fleet,—the largest,
says Lodge, since the death of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lord Northumberland was much commended for his services
in the expedition against the Dutch fishery, making
advantageous terms for the King of England, after which he
turned his time and thoughts to reforming many abuses then
prevalent in the Navy.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1637 he was named Lord High Admiral, and in 1639
commander of the troops marching against the Scots, but was
prevented—so he pleaded—from joining the army by illness,
when the real command devolved on the Earl of Stafford.
Clarendon says, ‘Lord Northumberland was chosen for ornament.’
It appears by a letter to his brother-in-law (Lord
Leicester) that he had most gloomy forebodings as to the
result of the enterprise, which ‘it grieves my soul to be involved
in.’ An incident occurred shortly afterwards, which
does not redound to the credit of the Earl of Northumberland.</p>

<p class='c012'>We will give an abridged account of Lord Clarendon’s
version. Henry Percy, a zealous Royalist, brother to the
Earl of Northumberland, was on his way to France, on the
King’s service, just at the time that the Commons had
petitioned Charles to prohibit any of his servants leaving
England. Striving to embark, he was attacked and wounded
by the people of the Sussex coast, and narrowly escaped with
his life to a place of concealment, whence he wrote to his
brother in a private and confidential manner. Northumberland
carried the letter to the House of Commons (which had
already voted an impeachment of high treason against Henry
Percy), and laid the document upon the table. Clarendon
makes but a lame defence for his conduct on the part of the
elder brother, who was, he said, ‘in great trouble how to send
Henry in safety beyond seas, when his wound was cured, he
having taken shelter at Northumberland House.’</p>

<p class='c012'>But the end of the matter was, that Henry did escape from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>England, and there was enmity between the brethren from
that day forth. This was the first time in which Northumberland
‘showed his defection from the King’s cause, and
Charles had been a good friend to him, and laden him with
bounties.’</p>

<p class='c012'>He acted in direct opposition to the King’s commands,
when he obeyed those of the Parliament, to equip the Royal
Navy, and to appoint the Earl of Warwick Admiral of the
Fleet.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1642 he resigned his commission of Lord High Admiral,
and openly abandoned his allegiance, siding with the Parliamentarians;
and though their faith was rather shaken in him
on one occasion, he was too valuable an ally to quarrel with.</p>

<p class='c012'>Northumberland was appointed head of the Commissioners
employed to negotiate with the King, in the several treaties of
Oxford, Uxbridge, etc., and was intrusted with the custody
of the Royal children, which he retained until the King’s
death. It would appear that he had at least the grace to
facilitate their interviews with their unhappy and loving
father, and that he cared for the wellbeing of his Royal wards.
They were subsequently committed to the guardianship of his
sister, the Countess of Leicester, and were removed to her
Lord’s house of Penshurst in Kent.</p>

<p class='c012'>Words, in truth, Lord Northumberland used to prevent the
execution of the King, but his deeds had hastened the catastrophe.
We are told he ‘detested the murder.’ Immediately
after Charles’s death Northumberland repaired to his seat at
Petworth, in Sussex, where he remained until 1660, when he
joined Monck in his exertions to bring about the Restoration.
He held no public office under Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>, excepting
the Lord-Lieutenancies of Sussex and Northumberland.
Clarendon, in a long character of him, says: ‘His temper
and reservedness in discourse got him the reputation of a wise
man. In his own family no one was ever more absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>obeyed, or had fewer idle words to answer for;’ and, alluding
to his defection from the Royal cause, ‘After he was first prevailed
upon not to do that which in honour and gratitude he
was obliged to, he was with the more facility led to concur in
what in duty and fidelity he ought not to have done, and so
he concurred in all the counsels which produced the Rebellion,
and stayed with them to support it.’</p>

<p class='c012'>He took great delight in his gardens and plantations at
Petworth, where he resided in the summer, but in the winter
he was much in town, attending to his Parliamentary duties.
He had two wives: the first was Lady Anne Cecil, daughter to
Thomas, second Earl of Salisbury. On her death we hear
Lord Northumberland ‘is a very sad man, and his sister
(Lady Leicester) has gone to comfort him.’ By Lady Anne
he had five daughters. His second wife was the second
daughter of Theophilus Howard, second Earl of Suffolk, who
brought him in Northumberland House in London, originally
called Northampton House. Sion House had been granted
by the Crown to the ninth Earl. Evelyn went to see it, and
thought it ‘pretty, but the garden more celebrated than it
deserved.’</p>

<p class='c012'>By Lady Elizabeth Howard, who long survived her husband,
he had an only son and heir, and a daughter, who died
unmarried. Algernon, Earl of Northumberland, was buried at
Petworth, in Sussex.</p>

    <div>SIR ANTHONY VANDYCK.</div>

A NATIVE of Antwerp, his father, a merchant
in silk and woollen stuffs, was himself a
painter in glass, whose first wife, Cornelia
Kerseboom, dying without children, he
married again one Maria Cuypers, by whom
he had a large family, Anthony being the
seventh, a proverbially magic number. The Vandycks were
strenuous adherents of the Church of Rome, and two of our
painter’s sisters became nuns, while one of his brothers took
Holy Orders. Maria Vandyck was a skilful artist in embroidery,
her works being much admired, and she encouraged her
boy’s taste for drawing, in the rudiments of which he received
instruction from his father. When about ten years of age he
was placed under the tuition of Henry van Balen, a much-esteemed
painter, who had studied in Italy. Here young
Vandyck remained some time, but he had fixed his heart on
becoming the pupil of his already famous fellow-citizen, Peter
Paul Rubens; and that desire was fulfilled. His remarkable
talent and his untiring industry made him a favourite both
with master and scholars, when an incident happened which
brought the youth into prominent notice. It so chanced that
one afternoon, when Rubens was absent, that the students
invaded the sanctity of the private studio, and in the exuberance
of animal spirits began to indulge in some rough play.
An unfinished Holy Family stood on the easel, the colours
not yet dry, and in the course of the ‘bear-fight’ one of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>companions pushed Van Diepenbeke so heavily against the
precious canvas that the arm of the Magdalene and the head
of the Virgin were nearly effaced, and the colours all smudged.
The general consternation may be easily conceived; a council
of war was held, and the decision arrived at that the most
skilful among the students should endeavour to repair the
mischief as best he could. Jan van Hoeck proposed Vandyck
for the work, and the choice was unanimously approved, for
in such a case there was no room for rivalry. Anthony set
to work in right earnest; there was not a moment to be lost.
He had but a few hours of daylight to complete his task,
but he accomplished it before nightfall. Early next morning
the dreaded moment arrived. Rubens entered his studio in
order to examine the work of the preceding evening, when he
pronounced the memorable words, which seemed to bestow
a diploma on his young disciple,—‘Why, this looks better
than it did yesterday!’ Then, approaching nearer, he
detected the traces of a strange hand. Investigation and
explanation followed, and Vandyck came in for great praise
from the lips of his loved master.</p>

<p class='c012'>Idle tales have been told of the jealousy subsisting between
these two great painters, while, on the contrary, every recorded
instance seems to prove how close was their friendship.
Rubens was most desirous that his talented pupil should
proceed to Italy to study the works of the great masters, and
extend his connection with the world, but in the meantime
Vandyck received an invitation to England. The first visit
he paid to our country was short and unsatisfactory; and
there are so many discrepancies in the accounts given of
the work done at that period, and his reasons for leaving
somewhat abruptly, that we refrain from entering on the subject.
From England he proceeded to the Hague, where he
painted portraits of every class and denomination of person,
commencing with the whole family and Court of the Stadtholder,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Henry Frederic, including every member of the illustrious
house of Nassau. Nobles, warriors, statesmen, burghers,
all vied for the honour of sitting to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1622 the news of his father’s illness recalled him to
Antwerp. He arrived just in time to receive that father’s last
farewell, and listen to his last injunctions. Franz Vandyck
made his son promise to paint an altar-piece for the chapel of
the Dominican Sisters, who had nursed him tenderly during
his illness,—a pledge nobly redeemed by Anthony, though
the execution was postponed for a time. He then took leave
of his master, to whom he presented, at parting, three
pictures, one of which was the likeness of Rubens’s first wife.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our painter now set his face towards Italy, but he did not
get far on his road without a hindrance. The story of the little
episode we are about to relate is so differently given, that we
only pretend to offer the most likely version.</p>

<p class='c012'>At Brussels, where Vandyck tarried, the Infanta Isabella
gave him a commission to paint the mistress of her Highness’s
favourite hounds, a beautiful girl, by the name of
Anna von Orphen. We are not told why a maiden of lowly
origin was chosen for a place, though not very exalted, about
Court, unless it were on account of her loveliness. But the
portrait was executed, and Anna appeared, surrounded by her
pack, each dog having its name duly inscribed on the canvas.</p>

<p class='c012'>The picture is mentioned as being at the castle of Tervueren,
near Brussels, in 1763. Vandyck speedily fell a victim to
the charms of the lovely villager of Saventheim, and at her
cottage he whiled away some months, to the great indignation
of Rubens, who continued to write and expostulate
with his former pupil, pointing out to him the value and
importance of the time he was losing. Vandyck, however,
was not wholly idle while at Saventheim; he painted (it is said
at the instigation of his mistress) two pictures: one a Holy
Family, in which he introduced likenesses of Anna and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>family, and the other a St. Martin, being his own portrait,
riding a horse which Rubens had given him. The last-mentioned
painting was held in such high estimation by the
inhabitants of Saventheim, that on three separate occasions,
at the interval of many years, the peasantry rose <i>en masse</i> to
prevent the treasure from being carried away, either by
fraud or purchase.</p>

<p class='c012'>At length Rubens hit on an expedient to extricate his
friend from the spells of his rustic Armida. He sent the
Chevalier Nanni, who was <i>en route</i> for Italy, to urge on
Vandyck the expediency of accompanying him thither. The
arguments chosen were successful; the lovers parted with
mutual regret. Poor Anna was left disconsolate, and Vandyck
set forth on a journey which was destined to be a triumphal
progress. We have no space to detail his residence at Venice,
where he studied Titian and Veronese, or his still longer sojourn
at Genoa, where he became the favourite guest of the proudest
nobles of the proud city, in which almost every palace is
enriched by the works of the great Fleming, chiefly consisting
of portraits, with a sprinkling of sacred subjects. This was
the period when, as Vandyck afterwards confessed, he painted
for fame, and not alone for money. At Rome, where he
remained several years, the first order he undertook was the
world-renowned portrait of Cardinal Bentivoglio, which, when
once seen, attracted crowds of sitters to the studio, as at
Genoa, including not only the nobility of the city, but most
of the visitors sojourning there at the time. A most curious
portrait of that period may now be seen at Petworth, representing
Sir Robert Shirley, who had come from the East on a
mission to his Holiness, representing him and his Persian wife
both in Oriental costume. In the Duke of Buccleuch’s
invaluable collection of miniatures there is a most eccentric
effigy of this same lady, in the dress—or shall we say undress?—of
her country.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>On leaving Rome, many writers say driven thence by the
jealousy of fellow-artists, especially among his own countrymen,
Vandyck proceeded <i>via</i> Florence to visit the more northern
cities of Italy, and after paying a second visit to his favourite
Genoa, he sailed with his friend, the Chevalier Nanni, for Sicily,
whither he had been invited by Prince Philibert of Savoy,
who sat to him, as did also the famous painter Sofonisba
Angusciola, celebrated alike for her talents and her romantic
adventures. This remarkable woman was in her ninety-second year,
and quite blind, but her mind was clear, and her
love of art as keen as ever; and Vandyck said he had
learned more from the conversation of this blind old lady
than from all his former studies.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a charming portrait of her by her own hand, when
young and handsome, in the collection of Earl Spencer at
Althorp. Vandyck was driven from Sicily by the breaking
out of the plague, and he once more set out for Antwerp,
which he reached about the end of 1626. In his native city
he at first shared the proverbial fate of the prophet in his
own country; he found few patrons, and many cavilled at the
prices, which were less than had been gladly paid him in Italy.
Rubens came to his rescue by buying every completed picture
in his studio, and, departing from Antwerp on diplomatic
missions (from the Archduchess Isabella) to Portugal and
England, left his friend Vandyck the undisputed master of
the field.</p>

<p class='c012'>His hands were now full. Orders from numerous religious
fraternities in the city and neighbourhood, anxious to enrich
their several churches and chapels, poured in on all sides, and
the candidates for the honour of sitting to the great painter
were incalculable. Yet Vandyck’s cup was mingled with gall,
through the envy and jealousy of his fellow-artists, who attacked
and traduced him on all occasions. He paid another short
visit to England, where the Earl of Northumberland was his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>chief patron and employer, and afterwards to Paris; but it was
not till 1632 that he listened to the persuasions of the Earl of
Arundel (who many years before had admired the early promise
of Vandyck’s talent), and once more went over to England.
In consequence of the death of Buckingham, who literally
‘brooked no rival near the throne,’ Lord Arundel was in high
favour with his Royal master, and King and subject were alike
enthusiastic worshippers of art.</p>

<p class='c012'>Vandyck was received at Court with every mark of distinction.
Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> provided apartments for him, and in all
respects treated him as a personal friend, taking the greatest
delight in his society. It was supposed that his Majesty
had even entertained the idea of building a house expressly
for his guest, since among the State papers, in the handwriting
of one of the officials, there is an entry, ‘Things to be done:
to speak with Inigo Jones concerning a house for Vandike.’</p>

<p class='c012'>The painter was however well lodged at Blackfriars, and a
pleasant summer residence at Eltham was also allotted him.
Indeed, wherever he went, Anthony Vandyck was the centre of
attraction, the cynosure of all eyes. Pre-eminently handsome,
brilliant in conversation, a good linguist, an enlightened
traveller, even without the crowning quality of his splendid
talent, the painter must assuredly have proved a shining light
in the refined and aristocratic circles of the English capital.
Courted in society, foremost in art, crowds resorted to his
studio. The King himself was not only his constant sitter,
but often dropped down the river in his royal barge as far as
Blackfriars, to pass a pleasant hour, and gossip of art and
artists with his newly-created knight, Sir Anthony Vandyck,
to whom he had presented a valuable miniature of himself,
splendidly set with diamonds. Neither of their Majesties ever
appeared wearied of sitting for their portraits to their ‘Painter
in Ordinary,’ and few records of a sad life can be more touching
than the three heads (at Windsor Castle) of Henrietta Maria,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>in which Vandyck so truthfully delineated the mental and
physical changes wrought by grief and misfortune.</p>

<p class='c012'>Amongst Vandyck’s closest and most intimate friends may
be reckoned the Earl of Strafford, whose noble and characteristic
countenance gazes intently at us from the walls of so many
dwelling-houses, and who was said to have sat oftener to his
artist friend than any one in England, with the exception of
Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> and his Queen. Sir Kenelm Digby was another of
Sir Anthony’s chosen companions, and the portraits of the
learned knight and his beautiful wife, Venetia Stanley, have become
familiar to us by the magic touches of Vandyck’s brush.
On the sudden and mysterious death of the ‘divine Venetia,’
her widower summoned the great painter to portray, for the
last time, that lovely countenance in ‘a calm unbroken sleep,
that hath no awakening,’—a beautiful and touching picture,
which forms one of the gems of Lord Spencer’s collection.
Notwithstanding the number of his sitters, and the large sums
(by comparison) paid for his paintings, Sir Anthony was invariably
in pecuniary difficulties. Luxurious in his manner of
living, splendid even to ostentation in his dress and equipages,
his hospitality was boundless, his generosity to struggling
members of his own profession proverbial. Added to all his
other expenses, there was invariably a Margaret Lemon, or
one of her class, ever ready to drain his purse. On the subject
of his monetary troubles, the noble knight was candid and
outspoken. One day the King and Lord Arundel were sitting
in intimate conversation with the painter in his studio at
Blackfriars, when Charles began a sorrowful dissertation on his
own lack of money. Turning to Sir Anthony, he said with a
smile, ‘And you, Sir Knight, has it ever happened to you to be
at a loss where to turn for one or two thousand pounds?’
‘Sire,’ was the reply, ‘when a painter keeps an open house
for his friends, and an open purse for his mistresses, he is not
unlikely to have empty coffers.’ It was doubtless on account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>of these pecuniary difficulties that Vandyck in his latter days
painted in so hurried and slovenly a manner, as might well
have gained him the name of ‘Fa Presto.’ He got into the
habit of intrusting many of the details of his paintings to the
numerous scholars in his studio, and the similarity of the
shape and character of the hands in his portraits, which has so
often been remarked and marvelled at, may surely be accounted
for by the fact that he usually painted the hands from those of
models of both sexes retained by him for that purpose. Yet
there were exceptions to this rule, for Vandyck, who had
beautifully formed hands of his own, was a great admirer of
that particular personal charm; and an amusing anecdote is
told of him, when he had a no less noble sitter than Margaret
de Bourbon, daughter to Henry <span class='fss'>IV.</span> of France. The Royal
lady, after watching Vandyck for some time, ventured the
question, why he gave so much more attention to the painting
of her hands than of her head, or indeed any other detail of
the picture. ‘It is, Madam,’ replied Sir Anthony, with a sly
smile, ‘that I anticipate a rich compensation from those
beautiful white hands.’</p>

<p class='c012'>It would not have been difficult, by all accounts, for
Vandyck to have selected a bride from the noblest and most
wealthy in the land, so generally admired was he by the fair
sex; but his friends, the King and the Duke of Buckingham,
had already arranged a suitable match, desirable in every way,
excepting that the lady was poor, a fact which seemed an
oversight in the circumstances, or rather in Vandyck’s circumstances.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mary Ruthven was the granddaughter of the unfortunate
Earl of Gowrie. Her father, suspected of complicity in the
so-called conspiracy, had in consequence not only been
imprisoned, but his property confiscated; therefore the winsome
lady’s dower consisted of goodness, beauty, and gentle
birth, but tocher the lassie had none, excepting a small portion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>given her as Lady of the Queen’s Household. She was much
esteemed at Court. During his residence in England Vandyck
had paid flying visits to his native country, and we hear of him,
in 1634, serving as Dean of the Guild of St. Luke’s at Antwerp,
which, be it remarked, is the date of the magnificent portrait,
in this same gallery of Panshanger, of John of Nassau Siegen,
and his family.</p>

<p class='c012'>After his marriage he proceeded once more with his bride
to his native city, where they were received with every possible
demonstration of respect and affection. Sir Anthony, then,
hearing that Louis <span class='fss'>XIII.</span> intended to have the walls of the
Louvre adorned with paintings, after the fashion of those
by Rubens in the Luxembourg, went to Paris in hopes
of obtaining the order, but in this design he was frustrated,
and, disappointed and depressed, he returned to England.
It was a dreary time. His Royal and private friends were
all involved in trouble and perplexity, through the gathering
of heavy clouds on the political horizon. His friend Lord
Strafford had perished on the scaffold; the King was absent
from London; the Queen had sought safety in France.
Vandyck’s spirits sank, and he gave himself up to a fatal and
visionary consolation.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the pursuit of the philosopher’s stone, he became a
professed alchemist, and, as it was well said, ‘the gold he had
gained by his labours fast melted away in the crucible.’</p>

<p class='c012'>He would stand for hours over a hot fire, which conduced
not a little to undermine his failing health; he grew haggard
and wrinkled while still in the prime of life. The King, on
his return to England, hearing of his friend’s illness, sent his
own physician to minister to the patient, holding out, it
was said, a large sum of money in the event of a cure. But
human aid was unavailing; a severe attack of gout, combined
with other maladies, proved fatal, and on the 9th December
1641, the man who by many has been esteemed the chief of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the world’s portrait-painters breathed his last. Followed by
a large retinue of friends, he was buried in St. Paul’s Cathedral.
It was but eight days before he died that a daughter was born
to him, and on the very date of his death there was an entry
in the register of St. Anne’s, Blackfriars, ‘Justiniana, daughter
of Sir Anthony Vandyck and his lady, baptized 9th December
1641.’</p>

<p class='c012'>Whatever ignorance or mismanagement of money matters
the great painter had shown during his life, his last will was
most praiseworthy and considerate in all points, and he had
waited until the birth of his child to complete the same.
There was not much to leave, but no one he loved or esteemed
was forgotten; wife, child, sisters, servants, were all remembered;
even the poor in the two parishes—that of his residence
and that of his burial—had a small sum dealt out to them.
Sir Anthony Vandyck’s widow married a Welsh baronet, Sir
Robert Pryse, as his second wife, but they had no children.
Justiniana married Sir John Stepney of Prendergast, Pembroke
(their grandson was George Stepney, the poet), and her second
husband was Martin de Carbonell. She received a pension
from King Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span></p>

A NATIVE of Brussels, his father was his first
master, and while quite young he found a
generous patron in the Archduke Albert of
Austria. This Prince gave the youth a
pension to enable him to go to Rome, and
study the art of sculpture, for which he
evinced a considerable talent. But the Duke dying when
Fiammingo (as he was called at Rome) was only twenty-five,
the young artist found himself in great poverty, and obliged to
work very hard to keep the wolf from the door. In the same
straits was at that moment the afterwards celebrated painter
Nicholas Poussin, and the two students became friends and
companions, sharing a scanty but common purse. The
painter and the sculptor sympathised in their love of art, but
differed in their taste of subjects. Poussin’s tendency was for
the severe, Fiammingo’s for the tender; his admiration for
the works of Albano led him to the execution of childish
forms in every imaginable attitude of grace and beauty; these
were seldom of large dimension, but he modelled the ‘Putti’
for the high altar in St. Peter’s, the Santa Susanna in the
Church of Our Lady of Loretto, near the Trajan Column, and
a colossal St. Andrew, also in St. Peter’s. Bernini, who was
evidently jealous of Fiammingo’s talent and popularity, said
he was incapable of executing anything more than a gigantic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>boy, but the admirers of pure art gave the palm to Fiammingo
far and away before the mannerist Bernini. Added to his
ability, the Flemish sculptor was a conscientious and indefatigable
workman. He not only produced statues, but made
careful studies in detail of the human figure, the hands and
feet in particular; but in spite of his industry he never extricated
himself from poverty. In 1646 he meditated going to France,
where doubtless his faithful friend, Nicholas Poussin, would
have befriended him, but a cruel death awaited him in Rome.
He was poisoned by his own brother, Jerome Duquesnoy,
himself a sculptor, who was jealous of Fiammingo’s increasing
fame. But the murderer did not escape vengeance; found
guilty of many crimes, he was (according to the barbarous
practice of the age) burned alive at Ghent. Of a gentle,
amiable disposition and winning manners, Fiammingo was
much esteemed and respected. Poussin and Albano were
among his closest friends.</p>

His heads of Madonnas, female saints,
and Herodias, are, for the most part, portraits
of his wife or daughter. Of the latter
there is a head in a Florentine palace,
crowned with bay leaves, representing
Poetry, which has more depth of colouring and expression

SHE was the sister of Alfonso d’Este, the
second Duke of Ferrara, but is immortalised
in history and fiction, prose and verse, as
the object of Torquato Tasso’s unfortunate
passion. The story of his residence at her
a brother’s Court, and at that of Urbino, where
her elder sister, Lucrezia, was Duchess, has so often been told,
and the details of his relations with the two Princesses so ill
authenticated and so variously narrated, that we do no more
than allude to the fact of the affection which subsisted between
them, although by many writers it is questioned which of the
two Princesses reigned supreme in the heart of the Laureate,
who was never wearied of singing the praises of both these
noble ladies.</p>

BORN at Dublin, the eldest of three sons, his
father a solicitor in good practice, his mother
a Miss Nagle, of County Cork, a Roman
Catholic, whose family had been zealous
adherents of James the Second. Edmund
and his brothers were brought up as Protestants,
their father’s faith; his only sister was educated
according to her mother’s religion. Young Burke went to
school at Ballitore, about thirty miles from Dublin, under the
tutelage of one Shackleton, a Quaker, and native of Yorkshire,
a good man, and a good teacher, who endeared himself to
his pupils, and of whom Burke spoke in the highest terms
of gratitude and affection, ‘who had,’ he said, ‘not only
educated his mind, but also his heart.’ While still a schoolboy,
Edmund had formed a close friendship with young
Shackleton, his master’s son, and continued to correspond
with him for many years on all subjects, classical, social, religious.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>In 1743 he went to Trinity College, Dublin, where, he
confesses, his studies were very desultory. ‘They proceeded
more from sallies of passion than preference for sound reason,
and, like all natural appetites that are violent for a season,
soon cooled.’ He thought it a humorous consideration to
reflect into how many madnesses he had fallen during the last
two years. First, the <i>furor Mathematicus</i>, then the <i>furor
Classicus</i>, the <i>furor Historicus</i>, the <i>furor Poeticus</i>; later on
he would have added to his list the <i>furor Politicus</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>Richard Shackleton, from whom he had parted with tears
at Ballitore, urges him, with tender admonitions, ‘to live
according to the rules of the Gospel.’ ‘I am desirous of
doing so,’ was the answer to the friendly little sermon, ‘but
it is far easier to do so in the country than in a town,
especially in Trinity College, Dublin.’ Burke sends Richard
a poetical description of the manner in which he spends his
day: how he rises with the dawn and careers through fragrant
gardens and meads, ‘mid the promise of May, till hunger
drives him home to breakfast; how he goes down to the
beach in the afternoon to sit upon the sea-wall and watch
the shipping, and the varying colours of the ocean in the
glowing sunset; and amid it all, how his thoughts travel back
to the sparkling river and pretty fir-woods of dear old Ballitore.
He finds time, however, almost every day, to spend at
least three hours in the public library, among the books, ‘the
best way in the world for killing thought.’ Assuredly far
better than most methods used for that purpose. ‘I have read
some history,’ he says, ‘and am endeavouring to make myself
acquainted in some degree with that of our own poor country.’</p>

<p class='c012'>During his whole life Burke loved and compassionated and
endeavoured to serve his own unhappy island. His only contemporary
of note at College was the Sizar, Oliver Goldsmith,
but they do not appear to have been acquainted. In 1750,
having taken his degree, Edmund went to London to study
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the law in the Middle Temple; but that species of study did
not suit his taste, although he expresses his high respect for
the same. He was never called to the Bar; he preferred
literature, courted the society of authors, frequented the
debating club in Covent Garden, and was a great lover of the
theatres.</p>

<p class='c012'>His father, who was a hard man, and had never
shown him much tenderness, was very angry at Edmund’s
neglect of legal studies, and either withdrew, or curtailed,
his son’s allowance so much as to make it difficult for him
to subsist in London. He was very fond of the country,
however, and used to go on walking expeditions, and spend
a great part of his summer in picturesque villages, reading
and writing all the time, in the companionship of William
Burke, his friend and namesake. He mentions his love
for wandering in a letter to Richard Shackleton, when, after
apologising for a long silence, he says, ‘I may have broken
all rules, neglected all decorums, but I have never forgot
a friend whose good head and heart have made me esteem
and love him.’ It was about the year 1756 that Edmund
Burke’s marriage took place, with the daughter of Dr.
Nugent, an Irish Roman Catholic, who had settled at
Bath. We hear that she was a gentle, amiable, and well-bred
woman, and a Presbyterian by creed. In this year
Burke published <i>A Vindication of Natural Society</i>, and his
immortal essay on the Sublime and the Beautiful. The
<i>Vindication</i> was written in the form of a letter to a noble
Lord by a late noble writer. It was intended to simulate
the style of Lord Bolingbroke, and was pronounced in that
respect eminently successful, so far as to deceive many
expert critics. It was a satire on the opinions of Lord
Bolingbroke, lately deceased, whose posthumous works
were now attracting great attention in the literary world.
Boswell is said to have asked Johnson in after years whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>he thought the <i>Vindication</i> would be damaging to Burke in
his political career. ‘No, sir,’ replied the Doctor; ‘though
it might perhaps be mentioned at an election.’</p>

<p class='c012'>Burke himself appears to have had the same misgivings
as Boswell, for, on the eve of standing for Parliament, he
thought it advisable to print a second edition of the
<i>Vindication</i>, with a preface, in which he explained that
the design of the work was ironical. When in London
he was not slow in forming friendships with all the eminent
men of the day, and amongst those with whom he became
most intimate were Reynolds, Garrick, and Samuel Johnson.
He was one of the original members (as was his
father-in-law, Dr. Nugent) of the Literary Club; and so
popular was he at the Turk’s Head, that Sir John Hawkins,
‘that most unclubbable man,’ was actually expelled from the
chosen circle on account of an attack he had made on Burke.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1758 he conceived the scheme of the <i>Annual Register</i>,
and proposed it to Dodsley, the great publisher of the day,
who was so much pleased with the notion that he immediately
embarked in the undertaking, and gave Burke £100
a year to contribute the ‘Survey of Events,’ which he continued
for many years. About the same time, the young
author was introduced to the man who is known to posterity
as ‘Single-speech Hamilton,’ on account of the brilliant
success of his maiden speech, which threw into the
shade such orators as Pitt (afterwards Lord Chatham),
Grenville, and Fox, who all spoke on the same occasion.
Horace Walpole met Burke at Hamilton’s house in company
with Garrick, and says of him, ‘A young Irishman
who wrote a book in the style of Bolingbroke, which has
been much admired. He is a sensible man, but has not
worn off his authorism, and thinks there is nothing so
charming in the world as writers, and to be one. He will
know better some day.’</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Mr. Hamilton went to Ireland, as private secretary to the
Viceroy, Lord Halifax, and Burke accompanied him. While
there he busied himself in inquiring into the grievances and
causes of discontent, especially among the Roman Catholic
portion of the community. It was owing to his liberal-minded
views on the subject of Catholic Emancipation that a
false rumour was spread that Edmund Burke had gone over
to his mother’s creed, with many other reports equally untrue.
Hamilton obtained for his companion a pension of £300 a
year from the Irish Treasury, which was at first received with
gratitude, but Burke would not accept the salary unconditionally;
he must have some of his time to himself for
literary labours; in fact, he could not barter his freedom.
Hamilton was offended. He wished to bind down the noble
spirit for life to his own personal service, or, as the writer himself
expresses it, ‘to circumscribe my hopes, to give up even
the possibility of liberty, to annihilate myself for ever.’ So
the pension was given up, the connection with Hamilton at
an end, and Burke returned to England.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1765 Lord Rockingham replaced George Grenville as
Prime Minister, and appointed Edmund Burke his private secretary.
This nomination caused much surprise and displeasure in
some quarters. The Duke of Newcastle expostulated with
the Premier, and denounced Burke as an Irish adventurer, a
Papist, a disguised Jesuit, with a false name, and what not.
Lord Rockingham put his secretary in possession of the
charges brought against him, all of which Burke denied, and
answered indignantly he would instantly vacate the post, as no
possible consideration would induce him to continue in relation
with any man whose trust in him was not entire. But
Lord Rockingham had implicit trust in his noble-hearted
secretary, and would not accept his resignation; and for
seventeen years, that is, till Rockingham’s death, the friendship
between these two distinguished men was unbroken, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>confidence unlimited. In December, this same year, Burke
was returned Member for the borough of Wendover. His
maiden speech, a few days after the opening of the session in
1766, on American affairs, produced the profoundest sensation,
and Pitt (the elder) not only complimented the young Member
himself, but congratulated the Ministry on their acquisition. Dr.
Johnson said, ‘No man had ever gained more reputation on his
first appearance.’ The second and third speeches were even
more successful, and it was universally admitted that Burke’s
eloquence carried the repeal of the American Stamp Act, which
measure was supported by Pitt, although in Opposition. The
Rockingham Ministry did not stand above twelve months, and
made way for what was termed the Grafton Administration,
the Duke being, for a time at least, nominal, and Lord
Chatham real leader of the party. Burke describes this
Government as a piece of joinery, curiously indented and
whimsically dove-tailed; a piece of tesselated pavement, without
cement, unsafe to touch, insecure to stand on.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1769 he became the possessor of The Gregories, in
the parishes of Penn and Beaconsfield, in Buckinghamshire.
He thus speaks of it to Shackleton: ‘I have made a push
with all I could collect, and the aid of my friends, to cast a
little root in this country. I have bought a house, with an
estate of about 600 acres, twenty-four miles from London:
it is very pleasant, and I propose, God willing, to become a
farmer in good earnest.’ He is sure his friend will approve
of the acquisition, when he knows it was once the property
of Waller the poet. There is always a large portion of the
community who consider it incumbent on them to inquire
into, and animadvert upon, their neighbours’ affairs, more
especially their finances. The world was much exercised over
the chances of Burke’s ability to defray such an expense
as the purchase of an estate; but there seems little doubt that
Lord Rockingham assisted him materially, and at his death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>that kind friend desired that all Edmund Burke’s bonds
should be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Irishman did not belie his nationality with regard to
money; it must be confessed he was lavish, and it is said
that from the day, in 1769, when he applied to Garrick for
the loan of £1000, till 1794, when he received a pension
from the Crown, he was never out of debt. But Burke’s extravagance
was far removed from selfishness; he never closed
his ear or his purse against the appeals of struggling talent
or deserving poverty, and was generous and compassionate
in every relation of life. In 1773, his only child, his ‘darling
Dick,’ having left Westminster, was entered student at Christchurch,
Oxford, but he being considered too young for College
life, his father determined to send him to Auxerre to study the
French language. The youth was lodged in the house of the
Bishop of the diocese, a good prelate, who treated him with the
utmost kindness, which Richard’s father amply repaid, when,
in after years, the Bishop visited England as an exile and
a pauper. Edmund Burke went to Paris at the same time,
not merely for the pleasure of making acquaintance with the
agreeable and distinguished members of society, but for the
purpose of investigating the causes of the revolutionary movement,
which was beginning by degrees to convulse the French
nation. He was presented to the Duchesse de Luxembourg,
and to Madame du Deffand, who laments that ‘the
Englishman speaks French so badly, in spite of which everybody
likes him, and thinks he would be most agreeable, if he
could make himself understood’! What a strange position
for Edmund Burke; he was able, however, to follow French
perfectly as a listener, and was much delighted with hearing
La Harpe’s tragedy of <i>Les Barmecides</i> read at the Duchess’s
house. He became acquainted with the Count de Broglie,
one of the King’s confidential Ministers, and Caraccioli, the
Neapolitan Envoy, and many members of the <i>haute noblesse</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Bent on weighing the balance of political opinion in Paris,
Burke did not confine his visits to the <i>salons</i> of one faction or
another; he was a frequent guest at the house of Mademoiselle
d’Espinasse, the well-known writer of love-letters so
ardent, that it was feared they would consume the paper
on which they were written! And here he saw the man who
inspired those tender epistles,—one Guibert, a colonel in the
Corsican Legion, who had lately written a book, which had
made a great noise in Paris, all the more that it had been
suppressed by the Government. Burke studied the men
and their works, and drew his own conclusions; he also, in
common with all foreigners, went to Versailles, and saw the
old King, Louis Quinze, at Mass, in a pew, just above
Madame du Barry, and the Dauphin and his young bride
dine in public with great pomp: Marie Antoinette, who,
‘glittering like the morning star, full of life, and joy, and
splendour,’—that vision of beauty, indelibly stamped on his
memory, which suggested many ‘words that burn,’ and inspired
many an enthusiastic and eloquent appeal in behalf of the
unfortunate French Sovereigns. Madame du Deffand flattered
herself that Burke had gone home enamoured with the nation
at large, but she was mistaken; he was never blinded, as
were so many of his countrymen, especially his own party, by
theoretical benefits of the French Revolution, but foresaw,
in all their terrible distinctness, the horrors and excesses
of the impending Reign of Terror. On his return to
London, he renewed his acquaintance with all the eminent
men of the day. His friendship with Johnson and Reynolds
lasted till the death of both those loved companions; and
Johnson, whose opinions, especially on politics, were usually
opposed to those of Burke, used to say he did not grudge
Edmund being the first man in the House of Commons, for
was not Edmund the first man everywhere? ‘Indeed, he is a
man, sir, that if you met him, for the first time, in the street,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>when, overtaken by a drove of oxen, you both stepped aside
for five minutes’ shelter, from whom you could not part without
saying, “What an extraordinary man!”’</p>

<p class='c012'>So extraordinary was Burke’s fame for eloquence, ability,
and the liberality of his views, that the important city of
Bristol chose him for their Member unsolicited. During
the time he represented them, the Bristolians, for the
most part, were very proud of their brilliant M.P., but his
popularity began to wane when he opposed war, and advocated,
not only Irish free-trade, but the Catholic Relief Bill.
It would appear that constituents, for the most part, aspire
to a despotic rule over the speeches and votes of their
representatives, in proportion to the democracy of their own
opinions. Now Edmund Burke was in reality what most
politicians are in name only, independent, and some words of
his that bear on this subject deserve to be engraved in golden
letters: ‘He who sits in Parliament should speak the language
of truth and sincerity, should never be ready to take up or
lay down any great political question for the convenience of
the hour; his duty is to support the public good, not to form
his opinions in order to get into, or remain in, Parliament.’
He therefore sacrificed his seat at Bristol to his love of independence;
for although his constituents, after attacking and
maligning him, offered to re-elect him, Burke went down in
person to <i>decline the honour</i>, in a speech, the eloquence of
which could only be equalled by its dignity. He was then
elected for Malton, the borough for which Lord Rockingham
had originally destined him, and for which he sat until
the close of his Parliamentary career. The Gordon Riots
broke out this year, and Burke’s house was one of the first
doomed to destruction, for ‘was he not the patron and promoter
of Popery?’ The authorities provided him with a
garrison of sixteen soldiers, thus saving his dwelling in Charles
Street, St. James’s, from sharing the fate of Sir George Savile’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>(who had brought in the Catholic Relief Bill),—his house
being gutted, and the whole of the furniture converted into a
bonfire. Savile was a neighbour of Sir Joshua Reynolds.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1782 Lord Rockingham once more resumed the head
of affairs, on the resignation of Lord North, and Edmund
Burke was appointed Paymaster of the Forces. This had
hitherto been a place of great emolument, but Burke was
not one to advocate reform in every department but his own—he
who had so lately urged economical reform in high places.
He considered the office overpaid, and cut it down, salary
and profits, to the tune of some thousands. His ‘dear Dick’
was made his father’s deputy, with a stipend of £500 a year,
and was shortly afterwards promoted to a better post under
Government. The death of Lord Rockingham broke up
the party. Burke resigned when Lord Shelburne came in,
but resumed office under the Coalition Ministry—Duke of
Portland, Premier. In 1784, ‘the pilot that weathered the
storm,’ William Pitt, took the helm, and Burke retired from
official life for good; but he never slackened in his Parliamentary
labours, taking a lead in all the important business of the
day, and, above all, displaying the liveliest interest in Indian
affairs. His name is indissolubly connected with that of
Warren Hastings, of whose impeachment he was the principal
mover; and during the weary prolongation of the trial, he
never rested from his attack on the Governor-General, either
by speech or writing. Suffice it to say, that, on the opening of
the trial, Edmund Burke made a speech which lasted four
days, and, at the conclusion of the proceedings, one which
occupied nine days, and was indeed a wonder, though it did
not influence the sentence, as Warren Hastings was acquitted.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the meantime all Burke’s preconceived notions of displeasure
at the progress of the Revolution in France were
more and more increased and confirmed by the rapid strides
which were being made towards the anarchy he had foretold.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>One memorable day he rose in the House to speak on
the subject which absorbed and agitated his mind. He was
worked up to a pitch of excitement; he commented, with
vehemence, on the encouragement which Fox’s eulogiums had
afforded the French Revolution, and went on to say that,
in speaking his mind, he was well aware he should this day
provoke enemies, and incur the loss of friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘No! no!’ cried Fox, ‘there will be no loss of friends.’</p>

<p class='c012'>Burke knew better; he knew what was in store for
him. ‘But if my firm and steady adherence to the British
Constitution place me in such a dilemma, I am ready to incur
the risk, and my last words shall be, “Fly from the French
Constitution!” I have done my duty at the price of my
friend; our friendship is at an end.’</p>

<p class='c012'>He was right in his prognostications; not only was there
a breach between him and Fox, who had been one of his
most intimate friends, and whom he henceforth met as a
stranger, but the whole party kept aloof from Burke. They
accused him of having deserted his principles, and the Whig
newspapers were most violent in their abuse. He was
annoyed and grieved by these charges, but they did not
influence his opinions or his conduct. He sent his son to
Coblenz, to communicate with the Royalist exiles, but the
mission was productive of no good. He published his
celebrated <i>Reflections on the French Revolution</i>, which converted
some readers to his way of thinking, and exasperated
others; and he continued to write pamphlet upon pamphlet
on the same subject, waxing warmer and warmer as he wrote,
and urging interference on the English Government. Miss
Burney, who met him about this time, writes that ‘he is not
well, and much tormented by the state of political affairs.
I wish you could see this remarkable man when he is easy,
happy, and with those whom he cordially likes; but politics,
even on his own side, must be carefully excluded: on that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>theme his irritability is so terrible that it gives immediately
to his face the expression of a man who is defending himself
against murderers.’ The news of the French King’s execution
produced a profound sensation in England, and turned the
current of feeling, for the most part, in the direction to which
Burke had so long, and vainly, endeavoured to direct it.</p>

<p class='c012'>We must not omit to record a strange episode in his
Parliamentary life that occurred on the bringing in of the
Alien Bill, which imposed certain pains and restrictions on
foreigners coming to this country. Fox had already spoken,
when Edmund Burke rose to address the House, and it was
easy to perceive he was, if possible, more excited than usual.
He thrust his hand into his bosom, and drew forth a dagger
with a tragic gesture which would have done honour to his
friend David Garrick; and flinging the shining weapon on the
floor of the House, called on all present to keep all French principles
from their heads, all French daggers from their hearts;... to
beware of the intrigues of murderous atheists, and so
forth; and he concluded by adjuring his audience to listen to his
warning, by all the blessings of time and the hopes of eternity!
This extraordinary proceeding, which is remembered in history
as ‘the dagger scene,’ produced, as may be imagined, different
effects on different hearers; there were some on whom it
made a deep impression, while there were others who accused
the speaker of having imagined and rehearsed a bit of melodrame.
Rehearsal there was none. The facts were these:
Burke, on his way to the House of Commons, had been shown
the dagger in question, which had been sent over from France
as a pattern for a large order to be executed in this country.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had announced his intention of retiring from public
life as soon as the trial of Warren Hastings should be
brought to a conclusion; and when at length it was so, he
applied for the Chiltern Hundreds, and his son Richard was
elected for his vacant seat.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Pitt proposed to confer a peerage on the man, for whom
he had, in spite of many opposite ways of thinking, a profound
admiration, by the title of Lord Beaconsfield; but
a storm was fast gathering, which darkened the remnant of
Burke’s life, and hastened his end.</p>

<p class='c012'>His only child, his idolised Richard, was attacked with
sudden illness, to which he succumbed. This young man’s
handsome face, familiar to us from the portraits by his father’s
friend Reynolds, bore a sullen and somewhat defiant expression,
which inclines us to believe the general verdict, that he
was a man of ungovernable disposition. Two years before
his death he had been sent to Ireland on business by the
Catholic Committee, and while there, as also on his return
to London, he had proved himself totally unfit for the trust
reposed in him. The character given of Richard Burke by
one who knew him well was as follows: ‘He is by far the
most impudent and opinionative fellow I have ever met.’
Yet in his parents’ fond eyes he was faultless, and few
things are more pathetic than the father’s allusion to his
heavy loss. ‘The storm has gone over me,’ he says; ‘I lie
like one of those old oaks that the late hurricane has
scattered round me; I am torn up by the roots; I am alone,
I have none to meet my enemies in the gate. I live in
an inverted order: those who should have been to me as
posterity are in the place of my ancestors.’</p>

<p class='c012'>Both the King and Pitt (the Premier) were anxious to
provide for the great statesman’s declining days, and a considerable
grant was assigned him by the Crown. Acceptable
as the relief from financial anxiety must have been to the
man, now advancing in years and bowed down by sorrow,
Burke was much disturbed that the question of the pension
had not been brought before Parliament. The sequel proved
that his scruples were well founded, for the Duke of Bedford
and Lord Lauderdale made this stipend a plea for attacking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the Government, to which they were in opposition. But
Edmund Burke, says one of his latest biographers, ‘was not
slow to reply, and, in his letter to a noble Lord, made one
of the most splendid repartees in the English language.’</p>

<p class='c012'>The ex-statesman in his retirement continued to write
political tracts, some of which were not published till after his
death. He found his best and truest consolation in the exercise
of that charity and benevolence in which his soul had ever
delighted. He had established at Beaconsfield a school for
the orphans of those who had perished in the French Revolution,
or the children of poor emigrants; sixty boys in number;
and it is pleasant to learn how, in the society of the little
ones he was befriending, his cheerfulness returned; how the
great man, the distinguished orator, would join in their
childish sports, roll with them on the green turf, and convulse
them with laughter by his ‘wretched puns.’ The visits
of some faithful friends at The Gregories gave him also
unfeigned pleasure, and he loved to speak with, or of, his
old associates. Alluding one day to Fox, he said, ‘Ah, that
is a man made to be loved!’ When he felt his end approaching
he sent affectionate messages to his absent friends, gave
calm directions respecting his worldly affairs, and enlarged
sorrowfully on the melancholy state of the country. Fox was
much affected when he heard of the death of his former friend,
and proposed that he should be buried in Westminster Abbey.
But the will provided otherwise: ‘A small tablet or flagstone,
in Beaconsfield Churchyard, with a short and simple
inscription. I say this, because I know the partiality of some
of my friends; but I have had too much of noise and compliment
in my life.’</p>

<p class='c012'>Burke left all he possessed to his ‘entirely loved, faithful,
and affectionate wife, with whom I have lived so happily for
many years.’ After mentioning several noblemen and gentlemen,
whose friendship he highly valued, and who all followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>him to the grave, he adds, ‘If the intimacy I have had with
others has been broken off by political difference on great
questions, I hope they will forgive whatever of general human
frailty, or of my own particular infirmity, has entered into that
consideration; I heartily entreat their forgiveness.’</p>

<p class='c012'>We insert this short extract, because we think this last of
Burke’s writings gives the best notion of his character, and
because we consider that the feelings which dictated these
words are sublime, and their expression beautiful. He does
not forget to recommend his little emigrants to the continued
generosity and patronage of William Pitt and other influential
personages. Edmund Burke was very popular with women,
‘even,’ says the biographer from whom we have already quoted,
‘those who were angry at his sympathy with American rebels,
his unkind words about the King (this was on the subject of
economical reform), and his cruel persecution of poor Warren
Hastings.’ Meantime he contrived to captivate such different
characters as Hannah More, Elizabeth Carter, and Fanny
Burney, who met him at Sir Joshua Reynolds’s on Richmond
Hill, and could not find terms for her admiration of his noble
air, commanding address, clear, penetrating, sonorous voice,
powerful, eloquent, copious language; at home on every subject,
she had never seen a more delightful man. His features
are familiar to us from the portraits of Sir Joshua and Romney,
who also painted him.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
CHARLES JAMES FOX, third son of the first
Lord Holland, was born in 1749.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lord Holland was the most able and
unprincipled of the able and unprincipled
statesmen of the school of Walpole. In
private life he seems to have had something
of the generous and sweet-tempered disposition of his son
Charles, towards whom he exhibited a boundless, but not very
judicious, affection. He spoilt him as a child. He gave him
so much money at Eton, as by example to inaugurate a new
state of things at that school, and he was constantly taking
him away from his studies at Oxford to indulge him prematurely
in the dissipations of fashionable life. He brought
him into Parliament before he was of age, and encouraged
him from the first to take part in every important debate.</p>

<p class='c012'>Such were the early circumstances of Charles Fox. His
abilities at once showed themselves to be of the very highest
order, and exactly fitted for the field in which they were to be
displayed.</p>

<p class='c012'>A power of close and rapid reasoning, combined with a
strength and passion which would have made even mere
declamation effective, a slight hesitation indeed in his cooler
moments, but when he was excited a flow of language almost
too rapid and too copious, and altogether inexhaustible, a
miraculous quickness in perceiving at a glance the weak points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>in the speech of an opponent, and a matchless dexterity in
taking advantage of them: these were the characteristics of his
extraordinary eloquence. In no age and no country could he
have found an audience more capable of appreciating his
particular gifts than the House of Commons of that period.
On the other hand, no audience could have been more ready
to forgive the total absence of preparation, the occasional
repetition, the want of arrangement and the want of finish,
which were his faults, and which would have seemed very
serious faults in the Athenian Assembly or the Roman Senate.</p>

<p class='c012'>His private life at the outset, and long afterwards, was stained
by dissipation of every kind. He entered Parliament with no
fixed principles. He was to the last unduly carried away by
the spirit of faction. But there was a goodness as well as a
manliness in his nature, and a justness in his judgment, which
were apparent from the very first, and which more and more
asserted themselves till they threw his faults entirely into the
shade. He grew steadily in character and estimation, till, at
the time of his death, he was regarded by a large circle with
an idolatrous attachment, which no other statesman has ever
inspired. More than twenty years after there were people
who could not mention his name without tears in their eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fox at once took a prominent part in public life. He
vehemently defended the unconstitutional action of the
Government against Wilkes, accepted office, was turned out
soon afterwards for speaking against the Ministry, struck right
and left for some time in an irregular manner, and finally, at
the age of six-and-twenty, settled down into steady and vigorous
Opposition to the war with our American colonists, which then
broke out.</p>

<p class='c012'>This threw him into association with Burke, and with the
Whigs, and his stupendous Parliamentary abilities made him,
before the end of the war, virtually the leader of the Opposition
in the House of Commons.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>In 1782 Lord Rockingham came in on the question of
acknowledging the independence of America. Fox and Lord
Shelburne were the Secretaries of State. Jealousies and disputes
arose between the two last, and when, in a few months, Lord
Rockingham died, open enmity was declared between them.
The King sent for Shelburne. Fox and his supporters formed
a coalition with the old war party, under Lord North. Shelburne
had to resign, and Fox, much to the disgust of the King,
became master of the situation, and with the Duke of Portland
for nominal Prime Minister, exercised complete power.
All this seems to us who live in these days very unprincipled,
and though the politicians of that depraved period do not
seem to have been much shocked, the general public took a
different view, as was very shortly made evident.</p>

<p class='c012'>At first Fox and North seemed to carry everything before
them; but retribution was at hand. The first great measure
which they brought forward was caused by the cruel and
unprincipled conduct of the servants of the East India Company.
It was no less a scheme than to vest the whole
Government of India for four years in the hands of a Commission
appointed by Parliament, or, in other words, by the
Ministers who happened at the moment to be in power. A
Bill to this effect passed the House of Commons almost without
opposition, but by the personal influence of the King it
was thrown out in the House of Lords, and Fox and the other
Ministers, though they commanded an immense majority in
the House of Commons, were immediately dismissed.</p>

<p class='c012'>They must speedily have been restored to power, if the
House of Commons had really represented the feelings of the
people; but this was not the case, for public opinion, as I have
said, had been thoroughly scandalised by the unnatural coalition
between two such completely opposite parties as those of
Fox and North. But in spite even of this state of public
opinion, it is very doubtful if the unexampled and absolute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>personal ascendency which Fox had established in Parliament
would not have ensured his speedy return, if another most
extraordinary man had not appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c012'>This was William Pitt, at this time only twenty-three years
of age. Pitt had shortly before burst forth upon the world as
a full-fledged orator of the very highest order. He now
assumed the lead of the Government in the House of Commons;
fought battle after battle, still defeated, but steadily
increasing his numbers, till he at last succeeded in arriving
within one of a majority. Then, and not till then, did he
dissolve Parliament, with so overwhelming a result, that he
remained for many a long year in complete though not unchallenged
possession of supreme power.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fox now entered upon what was destined to be a long career
of opposition. He was the acknowledged leader of the Whig
party in the House of Commons. Supported by Burke and
Sheridan and Windham, he waged ceaseless and desperate war
against the young Prime Minister. Never, perhaps, in the
whole course of our Parliamentary history was there a
brighter display of eloquence than at this period, though the
speakers were few in number, for this simple reason, that
none but the very best speakers could obtain a hearing. Pitt
and Fox towered conspicuously above these brilliant few.</p>

<p class='c012'>This sketch would be far too long if I were to attempt to
give any account, however brief, of the subjects of discussion
during the next few years, nor will I pretend to say which of
these great men was oftenest in the right or in the wrong.
Fox, however, certainly seems to lay himself open to the
charge that whatever Pitt brought forward he steadily and
systematically opposed.</p>

<p class='c012'>I will now come to the beginning of the French Revolution.
This tremendous occurrence so completely filled the minds of
all parties in England as to cause every other subject to be
forgotten. The first news of the destruction of the Bastile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>seems to have been received on the whole with satisfaction,
for the tyranny and corruption of the <i>ancien régime</i> were
well known, and justly reprobated in this country. But as
things went on, the upper classes began to become seriously
alarmed. The Tories, of course, led the way; and the brilliant
and forcible pen of Burke, the most richly gifted and learned
statesman, though not the most successful Parliamentary
orator, among the Whigs, expressed and inflamed the rising
passion of the people. The execution of the King, and still
more that of the Queen, were received with an outburst of
horror and indignation. Then came the Reign of Terror. By
this time there was a wild panic among owners of property.
The just hatred of the cruelty which was daily being perpetrated
rose to frenzy. The old national animosity against
France intensified the public fury. In short, the tide of
English feeling ran with such overwhelming force against
everything connected with the French Revolution, as to
sweep away from power and popularity every man who had
in the smallest degree identified himself with any of its
principles. Fox had done this. At the outset he had expressed
his exultation, in his usual vehement manner, and
afterwards, when others had begun to stand aghast, he in
the main adhered to his opinion. Nobody inveighed more
strongly against the Royal murders, and the other atrocities,
but he still clung to the belief that the ultimate result would
be good. He strongly opposed the interference of Europe,
and particularly of England, with the internal concerns of
France. He denied that there was any necessity for our
going to war, and during the war he continued on every
possible occasion to urge the Government to make peace.
The opinion of later generations has, I think, on the whole,
decided that he was right, though people are still divided
upon the subject. But, be this as it may, it is impossible
not to admire his conduct during these years. His once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>proud and powerful party was scattered to the winds. His
‘darling popularity,’ as Burke had formerly called it, altogether
disappeared. Friends of long standing became estranged,
and he was one who felt acutely the dissolution of friendship.
Still, however, he remained firm to his principles.
Session after session, though he stood almost alone, he continued
to advocate his views with such masterly ability as to
extort the applause even of his enemies. But at last, so
hopeless did he find it to contend any more against the
stream, that, though he retained his seat, he almost ceased
to attend Parliament.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fox now retired to his house at St. Ann’s Hill. He had
become the most domestic of men, and in company of the
only woman he ever really loved, and whom he soon afterwards
married, he gave himself up to all the pleasures of
literary ease. In spite of the dissipation of his youth, and
the activity of his maturity, he had contrived to acquire a
large amount of information, and such was the constitution
of his mind, that whatever he learned he learned thoroughly.
He was an accomplished and accurate classical scholar, well
acquainted with modern languages, and well versed in the
history and the poetry of all countries and all times. His
letters at this period to his nephew, Lord Holland, throw a
very pleasing light upon his pursuits and character, and enable
us to a certain extent to realise the fascination which he possessed
in his middle age for those who were just entering
upon manhood. Every subject is treated of in turn in the
easiest and most spontaneous manner; Greek and Latin
authors are critically examined, and their corresponding
passages compared, or a canto of Ariosto is discussed, or a
couplet from one of Dryden’s plays is pointed out as capable
of being happily quoted in a speech on current politics. Nor
are the deeper lessons of history forgotten, nor the public
events of the moment; and all this in the simple and familiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>language of a man of the world, frequently illustrated by
similes drawn from racing or other sport. So far is there
from being any touch of pedantry or condescension, that it
seems as if he was asking his nephew’s advice upon all these
matters, rather than giving any opinion of his own. It was
at this time he wrote his book upon the reign of James <span class='fss'>II.</span>
These years in which, as a public man, he was almost totally
eclipsed, were perhaps the happiest in his life. On the rare
occasions when he was persuaded by his few remaining
political friends to appear in Parliament, and to make a
speech, he left home with the most intense reluctance, and
returned there with all the pleasure of a schoolboy at the
end of the half.</p>

<p class='c012'>After the Peace of Amiens he went to Holland and France,
and was received everywhere with respect and admiration.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the renewal of the war, his Parliamentary attendances
became more frequent. He gathered round him a gradually
increasing body of devoted personal adherents, drawn largely
from the new generation. In his vigorous denunciation of
the manner in which the war was conducted, he frequently
found himself supported by the most extreme members of
the war party. Many of these, like Windham, had originally
been Whigs, and the remembrance of old friendship assisted
in cementing the new alliance. There seems also to have
been at this time a growing feeling that one who divided
with Pitt, and with Pitt alone, the reputation of being the
ablest and most illustrious statesman of the day, should no
longer be excluded from the service of the State. On the
death, therefore, of his great rival, in 1806, when Lord
Grenville became Prime Minister, Fox was at once, and
with general applause, made Secretary for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p class='c012'>His efforts were immediately directed towards carrying
out what had long been his wish,—the making of an honourable
peace. But he found that this was no easy matter. It had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>suited the purpose of his political opponents to represent him
as being deficient in patriotism, and this charge has been
since repeated. There is nothing in his public speeches
to justify this odious accusation, and those passages in his
private letters which seem to lend some colour to it exult,
it is quite true, in the victories of the French arms, but only
over the Austrians and the Prussians. He writes with all
the feelings of an Englishman at the news of the battle of
Trafalgar, though he cannot help lamenting that one of the
effects of that brilliant victory will be to confirm the Government
in what he considers a mistaken policy. But the chief
answer to the charge which I have mentioned may be found
in his conduct, now that for the first time he was installed in
a responsible position. Notwithstanding his ardent and
avowed desire for peace, the French soon discovered that
they had to deal with a man who could be as tenacious as
Pitt himself, when the real interests and the honour of his
country were concerned. Negotiations were protracted, and
he was not destined to effect his object.</p>

<p class='c012'>But we are within sight of the end. Fox was still in
what we should now call middle age. He had long renounced
the vices and excesses of his youth. The factiousness
and the ambition of later years were also extinct. His
intellect, without losing the smallest portion of its power, had
acquired a calm serenity. Never did he stand higher with
the public, and never was a statesman surrounded by a more
faithful and admiring band of supporters. It seemed as if
at last his mighty talents were to have free scope, and that
his renown as an orator was to be equalled by his success as
a ruler of men. But it was not to be. Nature cannot be
overstrained with impunity, and he had tried his constitution
very severely in his earlier days. He was in bad health when
he took office, he was soon found to be suffering from dropsy,
and he sank rapidly. He died in September 1806, attended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>by his wife, his nephew, and his niece, with all the affection
due to such a man.</p>

<p class='c012'>His vigorous mind was still unclouded, and he retained
his high courage and his sweet temper to the last.</p>

JEAN FRANÇOIS PAUL DE GONDI was
born at Montmirail en Brie. His father,

The family was originally Florentine, and
the first who settled in France was Albert Gondi, son of
a Tuscan banker, who was Marshal of France under
Catherine of Medicis. It was easy to trace his Southern
descent in the warm blood that raced through the veins of
Jean François de Gondi. Two members of the family had
already sat on the Archiepiscopal throne of Paris; Emmanuel
destined his son to be the third, and with that view he caused
him to be educated as a priest, under the auspices of Vincent
de Paul, the pious confessor of Anne of Austria. Assuredly
the pupil did not follow in the master’s footsteps. It was
said of the two men by a contemporary, ‘Il en fit un saint,
comme les Jésuites firent de Voltaire un dévot.’ No vocation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>in the world could have been less fitted for the wild, worldly,
and ambitious spirit of the young acolyte,—a fact which he
vainly endeavoured to force on his father’s mind by the
irregularities of his conduct. He not only indulged in every
excess, but gloried in making his behaviour known to the
world: a duellist, he had already had two hostile meetings,
he spoke openly of his <i>affaires d’honneur</i>; a man of gallantry,
he boasted of his <i>affaires de cœur</i>,—indeed, among many others,
he relates how at one time he was on the point of carrying
off his beautiful cousin, Mademoiselle de Retz; a conspirator,
he had gone so far as to plot against the life of Richelieu.
He had contrived to incur the enmity of the Minister by
crossing his path, both in love and friendship, and they hated
each other cordially. When only eighteen, De Retz had
shown his predilection for secret conspiracy by writing a
panegyric on the Genoese Fiesco. But with all these warring
and tumultuous propensities, he could not shuffle off the
clerical habit which weighed so heavily on his young shoulders.
He took an abrupt resolution, made a virtue of necessity,
preached brilliant sermons, wrote fervent homilies, became
remarkable for his deeds of charity, and paid court to the
higher members of the Church,—and, crowning glory, he
invited a learned Protestant to a polemical conference, and
brought him home safely into the fold of Mother Church.
This conversion made such a noise in Paris as to reach the
ears of the old King, Louis <span class='fss'>XIII.</span>, then on his deathbed, who
immediately named Gondi Coadjutor to his kinsman, the
Archbishop of Paris, a post that was usually a stepping-stone
to the Archiepiscopal See itself. Gondi now preached
sermons, the eloquence of which made him the theme of conversation,
more especially the very flowery discourse which
he delivered on his first appearance at Court; but his growing
popularity among the citizens of Paris, during this time of
strife between the Parliament and the Regency, made him an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>object of suspicion to the Queen. He lavished enormous sums
of money in largesses to the lower classes in Paris, which
caused him to become too popular with one party not to excite
the fears of the other. Being one day reproached for his
prodigality, Gondi, who always took the ancient Romans as
his models, said flippantly, ‘Why should I not be in debt?—Cæsar
at my age owed six times as much as I do.’ In the
growing struggle between the popular party and the Court, he
temporised and coquetted with both. He refused to join the
cabal of ‘Les Importans’ against Mazarin, the Prime Minister,
whom he much disliked, and on the breaking out of the revolt,
on the day of the first barricades he exerted himself to protect
the Queen and her surroundings. Habited in full pontificals,
the Coadjutor mixed with the crowd, exhorted them to respect
the building of the Palais-Royal, and exposed himself so far as
to be thrown down and bruised by a stone, which was hurled
at him. Yet, when in the course of the evening he sought
the Royal presence, in the expectation of receiving thanks for
his conduct, Anne’s reception was cold and haughty. ‘Allez-vous
reposer, Monsieur,’ she said, ‘vous avez beaucoup
travaillé.’</p>

<p class='c015'>The slights put upon him by the Court, and a further offence
given him by the Queen, determined Gondi to co-operate with
the opposite faction. We have given a full account of the
history of the Fronde in the notice of Marshal Turenne, and
shall therefore only allude to the personal actions of Gondi,
who became, if not at first the nominal leader, assuredly the
moving spirit, of the malcontents. He had expressed his
opinion some time before, that it required higher qualities
to be leader of a party faction than to be emperor of the
universe, and he now resolved to show his qualifications for
that position. ‘Before noon to-morrow,’ he said, ‘I <i>will</i> be
master of Paris.’</p>

<p class='c015'>Now began that epoch of internal warfare in France, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the men of action and strong will rose to the surface, without
reference to the honesty or morality of their characters. ‘Les
troubles civils,’ says one of the historians of the Fronde, ‘sont
le règne des oiseaux de proie.’ The Regent and her Minister
well knew how much they had to fear throughout the wars of
the Fronde, throughout the ups and downs of popularity and
hatred from such men as Gondi, who became in time both
Archbishop of Paris and Cardinal, and maintained for the
most part his political ascendency until the conclusion of the
civil war in 1652, when the Court returned to Paris. He was
offered to go to Rome as Ambassador, but hesitated and
demurred and procrastinated, till Anne of Austria’s old hatred
broke out afresh, and he was arrested and conveyed, without
any resistance on the part of his good Parisians, to the Château
de Vincennes. Here he was treated with much severity, and
could only gain the favour of being transported to the ancient
Castle of Nantes at the price of some concessions in ecclesiastical
matters. He contrived to escape, through an ingenious
contrivance, and to evade the vigilance of the guards during
one of his daily promenades on the ramparts, though he
ran great risks while dangling to a rope, which had been
thrown over the wall for his descent. Two young pages saw
him, and cried loudly to the soldiers above, but as the Cardinal’s
good star would have it, there was a great tumult going on
below on the banks of the river. A bather was drowning, and
people were shouting and calling for help in all directions, so
that the boys’ feeble voices were unheard, or confounded with
the general uproar. The Cardinal had friends awaiting his
descent with horses, and they set forth at a furious pace, intending
to make their way to Paris. But the Cardinal’s horse was
scared by the report of a pistol which De Retz himself had
fired on a supposed pursuer, and the rider fell to the ground,
dislocated his shoulder, and had to ride for many leagues in
tortures of pain. After passing several nights in misery and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>apprehension, hiding in barns and outhouses, under piles of
hay, half suffocated, the fugitive contrived to reach the
Spanish frontier, whence after a short sojourn he repaired to
Rome. He had a very good reception, despite the rancour
of the French Cardinals, and made himself conspicuous at the
Conclave by his eloquence, which was instrumental in securing
the election of Alexander <span class='fss'>VII.</span> This smoothed the way
for his return to France, where the King received him well;
but the firm spirit of De Retz was not broken, and he
withstood to the uttermost the endeavours, both of Louis and
Mazarin, to make him resign his Archbishopric. However,
he was at length persuaded to exchange it for the Abbey of
St. Denis. The rest of his life, we are told by some of his
biographers, was passed in retirement, piety, and charitable
deeds. By some we are also told that his humility was so
great that he offered to resign the Scarlet Hat, of which he was
unworthy; but other writers are sceptical enough to doubt his
good faith in this transaction, and to whisper that while he
tendered his resignation to the King, he sent secret petitions
to the Pope to refuse this offer. One thing is certain: the
Cardinal became economical, and paid to the uttermost
farthing the enormous debts which he had contracted. In
his latter days he found amusement in the compilation of his
own memoirs, which are characterised by extreme candour;
and he found consolation in the society and friendship
of Madame de Sévigné. In her charming Letters this
admirable writer praises the tired man of the world for his
charming conversation, his elevation of character, and his
mild and peaceable disposition. Surely it must be acknowledged
that our Frondeur had reformed! She speaks of his
constant visits. ‘Nous tâchons,’ she says, ‘d’amuser notre
bon Cardinal; Corneille lui a lu une pièce qui sera jouée
dans quelque temps, et qui fait souvenir des anciennes.
Molière lui lira, samedi Trissotin, qui est une fort plaisante
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>chose. Despréaux lui donnera son lutrin, et sa poétique.
Voilà tout ce qu’on peut faire pour son service.’ He died in
Paris at the Hôtel Lesdiguierés in 1679. Madame de
Sévigné, writing on the subject to her daughter, says, ‘Cette
mort est encore plus funeste, que tu ne saurais le penser.’
‘These ambiguous words,’ observes a French writer, ‘were
considered very mysterious at the time, but the easy solution
appears to be that the Cardinal had, unknown to Madame de
Grignan herself, stated or hinted at the fact that he intended
to make that lady his heir, a circumstance of which her
mother was cognisant.’</p>

<p class='c015'>De Retz at one time not only aimed at superseding his
enemy, Cardinal de Mazarin, in his post at the Councils, but
also in the affections of the Queen-Regent, a project in
which he was utterly foiled. Voltaire, speaking of his Autobiography,
says it is written with an air of grandeur, an
impetuosity, and an inequality of genius, which form a perfect
portrait of the man; it might be added,—with an audacious
candour, from which many writers of their own memoirs would
have shrunk.</p>

    <div>THOMAS HOBBES.</div>
    <div class='c000'><i>Black gown. Grizzly hair.</i></div>
    <div class='c000'>BORN 1588, DIED 1679.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c022'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/dc-b.jpg' width='100' height='100' alt='' />

BORN at Westport, an outlying parish of
Malmesbury, of which his father was the
Vicar,—‘a man who cared not for learning,
having never, as Aubrey tells us, ‘tasted the
sweetness of it.’ Thomas Hobbes’s advent
into the world was premature, in consequence
of his mother’s terror, caused by the rumours of the
impending invasion of the Spanish Armada.</p>

<p class='c015'>One of his biographers truly remarks, ‘The philosopher was
not in such a hurry to leave as to enter the world, since he
lived to attain his ninety-second year.’ In a Latin poem,
written when he was past eighty, he terms himself, ‘Fear’s
twin,’ alluding to his mother’s fright, and says, ‘That is the
reason, methinks, why I so detest my country’s foes, being a
lover of the Muses, and of peace, and pleasant friends.’</p>

<p class='c015'>He began authorship while still a schoolboy at Malmesbury,
by translating the <i>Medea</i> of Euripides into Latin verse.</p>

<p class='c015'>He is described as a playful boy enough, but with a spice
of contemplative melancholy, ‘who would get himself into a
corner, and learn his lessons presently.’ His chief amusements
consisted in ‘catching jackdaws with cunningly-devised traps,
and strolling into booksellers’ and stationers’ shops, in order
to gape at maps or charts.’</p>

<p class='c015'>A generous uncle sent him to Oxford, where he was regular
in his studies and in his habits, at a time when, as he tells
us in the <i>Leviathan</i>, drinking, smoking, and gambling were the
order of the day at Oxford.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The Principal of his College, Magdalen Hall, recommended
the young student to the notice of Lord Cavendish
of Hardwicke (afterwards the first Earl of Devonshire), who
appointed him tutor to his eldest son; and thus began a friendship
with that noble family which endured for upwards of
seventy years, even to the end of Hobbes’s long life. Tutor
and pupil were of the same age, nineteen years, and together
they made the grand tour of France, Germany, and Italy,
reaping great advantages from the opportunities thus afforded
them. As to Hobbes, he cultivated the society and conversation
of all the men of eminence in the countries through
which they passed, ‘at a time,’ says a recent writer, ‘when the
spirit of inquiry was rife in Western Europe.’ He mastered
modern languages, and laid the foundation of friendships
which stood him in good stead in after life. On his return he
devoted himself more than ever to the study of the Classics,
translating and commenting on the Greek and Latin poets of
antiquity, so that his works began to attract considerable
attention. He resided with the Cavendish family, both in
the country and in London, and greatly utilised the resources
of the library at Chatsworth; while in London he frequented
the society of such men as Lord Bacon, Ben Jonson, Lord
Falkland, Herbert of Cherbury, and others.</p>

<p class='c015'>King James <span class='fss'>I.</span>, who was a match-maker, brought about
a marriage between young Lord Cavendish (Hobbes’s pupil)
and the only daughter of his favourite, Lord Bruce of
Kinloss, in Scotland. The King gave her a good portion, and
induced Lord Devonshire to make a handsome settlement on
her; but the excellent qualities of this remarkable woman
would have made Christian Bruce a desirable alliance for any
family in England, even had she not been so well endowed.
She was a competent and superior lady, as her after life proved.
But heavy clouds were gathering over the house of Cavendish.
In 1626 died William, first Earl of Devonshire, son of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>celebrated Bess of Hardwicke, and in 1628 his son, the second
Earl. Hobbes mourned them both sincerely, but especially
the last mentioned, his dear lord, friend, and pupil; in a
letter to whose son and successor, after speaking in the
highest terms of the deceased, and enumerating his many
virtues and endowments, he goes on to say, ‘What he took in
by study, he by judgment digested, and turned into wisdom
and ability, wherewith to benefit his country.’</p>

<p class='c015'>This was in every respect a severe loss to Hobbes. The
establishment at Chatsworth was broken up, and the widowed
Countess was left in great pecuniary difficulties. Her son (who
was of tender age) had his estates charged with thirty lawsuits,
‘which, by the cunning of her adversaries, were made as
perplexed as possible; yet she so managed, with diligence and
resolution, as to go through them all with satisfaction.’</p>

<p class='c015'>One day King Charles said jestingly to her, ‘Madam, you
have all my judges at your disposal.’</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1628, Hobbes published his translation of Thucydides,
which attracted great attention, and brought down on the
author many severe attacks. In an opening dissertation on
the life and works of the Greek historian, Hobbes endeavoured,
by the example of the Athenian, to warn his countrymen
against the evils of democracy, at a moment when political
strife was raging and the Monarchy in danger. For Hobbes
was a zealous Royalist, and believed that the cause of the
King was in essentials the cause of law and order. Thrown
for a while on his own resources, he accepted the post of
travelling tutor to the son of a country gentleman, with whom
he went on the Continent, residing chiefly at Paris, where he
took up mathematics as a new study. It was not long, however,
before the widowed Countess of Devonshire recalled
the friend of her father-in-law, the tutor of her husband, to
occupy the same position in the family, and superintend the
education of her sons, the young Earl and her beloved Charles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the gallant soldier who closed his short and noble career by
dying for his King on the field of Gainsborough.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1634 old memories were recalled and old habits
resumed by Hobbes taking his youthful charge over very
much the same ground as he had travelled with his first pupil
some years before, ‘making the longest stay in Paris for all
the politer parts of breeding,’ having during his sojourn in
Italy inspired the admiration and gained the friendship of
Cosimo de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and paid a
visit at Pisa to the illustrious Galileo,—‘for I also,’ says
Hobbes of himself, ‘am now numbered among the philosophers.’</p>

<p class='c015'>In Paris, where Richelieu was in the zenith of his power,
and had just founded the Academy, Hobbes fraternised,
as was his wont, with all the learned men, and was on the
most intimate terms with every one in any way remarkable
for culture, whether in literature, science, or philosophy.
In 1637 Lord Devonshire with his governor went back to
England, where he found that his mother had taken advantage
of his absence to restore order into his estates, which she now
gave up to him, free and unencumbered of debt, and his
beautiful homes well furnished to receive him.</p>

<p class='c015'>England was in a most perturbed state on the travellers’
return. Hampden’s trial, the insurrection of the Scots, the
violence of Parliament, all presaged the impending downfall
of the Monarchy. Hobbes’s natural bias, as we have already
said in a former page, was in favour of the Royal cause,
a sentiment which was naturally fostered by the Cavendishes,
who were one and all zealous Royalists; their hearts, lives,
and fortunes, were ever at the service of the Throne. And so
it came to pass that our philosopher raised his voice and
wielded his pen in support of the King, until, as the saying
goes, the country was too hot to hold him, and he fled. He
thus speaks of his own reasons for taking this step:—</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>‘On the meeting of the second Parliament, when they
proceeded fiercely against those who had written or preached
in defence of regal power, Mr. Hobbes, doubting how they
would use him, went over into France, the first of all that fled,
and there continued eleven years.’ Here he made a short
friendship and quicker quarrel with the celebrated Des Cartes;
here, when once brought to the brink of the grave, whatever
his religious opinions were, he resisted the endeavours of an
Italian friend to gain him over to the Roman Catholic faith;
here, his health re-established, he published manifold works,—philosophical,
theological, and polemical,—which attracted
great attention, and his fame spread so far and wide that it
was said people came from great distances even to gaze on
the portrait of Mr. Thomas Hobbes.</p>

<p class='c015'>Public favour was very much divided, and some of those
who could not deny his eloquence and brilliancy of style
inveighed against the heterodoxy of his tenets. While in
Paris, he gave instructions in different branches of learning,
especially mathematics, to the Prince of Wales, afterwards
Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>, who was then in exile; and his intercourse with
the Prince, and the intimacy which he formed with many of
the English Royalists then residing in Paris, helped to foster
Hobbes’s hatred of the popular party in England.</p>

<p class='c015'>John Evelyn, in his Diary, says, ‘I went to see Mr. Hobbes,
the great philosopher of Malmesbury, at Paris, with whom
I had been much acquainted. From his window we saw the
whole procession and glorious cavalcade of the young French
monarch, Lewis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span>, passing to Parliament, when first he took
the kingly government upon him, he being fourteen years of
age, and out of the Queen’s pupilage. The King’s aydes, the
Queen-Mother, and the King’s light horse all in rich habits,
with trumpets, in blue velvet and gold; the Swiss in black velvet
toques, headed by two gallant cavaliers in habits of scarlet
satin, after their country fashion, which is very fantastick.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>The Kinge himself looked like a young Apollo. He was
mounted on an Isabella barb, with a houssing of crosses of
the Order of the Holy Ghost, and <i>semée fleurs-de-lys</i>, stiffly
covered with rich embroidery. He went almost the whole
way with his hat in his hand, saluting the ladys and acclamators,
who had filled the windows with their beauty, and the
aire with “Vive le Roy!”’</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1651 Hobbes wrote the book so indissolubly connected
with his name, <i>Leviathan</i>. When this work was first
circulated in Paris, he found himself the object of aversion
to every class. To readers of every way of thinking,
there were passages at which to cavil and take objection.
Indeed, Hobbes was warned that from the priesthood
his life was in danger; and he once more sought safety in
flight. He returned to England, where he published the
obnoxious volume, and took up his abode in London for
some time, in Fetter Lane, made his submission to the
Council of State, and busied himself with literary labours,
English and Latin. The winter of 1659 he spent with his
friends at Chatsworth, and in 1660 came up to London
with them to Little Salisbury House. One day, soon after
the Restoration, the King was passing through the Strand,
when he perceived his old master standing at the gate of
Lord Devonshire’s house. The Royal coach was stopped,
Charles doffed his hat most graciously, and inquired after
Mr. Hobbes’s health, who was summoned to the Palace
before a week was over, and found himself sitting for his
portrait by Royal command. We are told that the king of
limners, Mr. Cooper, was much delighted with Mr. Hobbes’s
pleasant conversation, and that his Majesty delighted in his
wit and repartees. The Merry Monarch’s courtiers would
‘bayte’ Mr. Hobbes, so much so that when he appeared the
King would often cry, ‘Here comes the bear to be bayted.’
But the philosopher knew how to take his own part, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>answers were always full of wit and drollery, but usually
evasive, from fear of giving offence. The King granted him an
annual pension of £100 a year, but refused his petition of a
grant of land to found a free school at Malmesbury.</p>

<p class='c015'>He continued his controversial writings, which brought
down upon him attacks from all quarters. The publication of
his works was prohibited in England, which determined him
to bring out a complete edition of them at Amsterdam. The
cry against him continued, and an undergraduate at Cambridge
venturing to support some of his most daring theories, was
summarily expelled the University, while Adam Hood, who
had affixed a panegyric on the philosopher to the commencement
of the Antiquities of Oxford, was compelled to suppress
half his compliments. Hobbes retired into the country,
translated Homer into English, wrote the <i>Philosophical
Decameron</i>, and the <i>Civil Wars in England</i>, which he dedicated
to the King, with a petition to be allowed to publish it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Charles was much displeased with the book, and gave him
a flat denial. During the panic which was caused by the
plague and fire of London, a Bill was brought into Parliament
for the suppression of all atheistical writings, and a committee
formed to inquire into any work suspected of promulgating
such doctrines. Public attention was directed towards
<i>Leviathan</i>, and many people believed that the greater number
of the Bishops would willingly have roasted the old philosopher
alive; at all events, Hobbes was much alarmed, being in terror
of the whole Bench, more especially of the Bishop of Ely,
whom he had offended. He accordingly burned a great
portion of his papers, and took his departure for Chatsworth.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was well for Hobbes, that, disappointed and thwarted in
many ways, he had so peaceful and beautiful a haven wherein
to anchor. Lord Devonshire allowed his old tutor to live
under his roof in ease and plenty, claiming no service of any
kind in return for so much hospitality. Neither the Earl nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>his wife subscribed in any way to Hobbes’s opinions, but often
expressed their abhorrence of his principles, both in politics
and religion, sometimes avoiding mention of his name, or
excusing him in some measure by saying he was a humorist,
and there was no accounting for him.</p>

<p class='c015'>But they were uniformly kind to the old man, in spite of it
all. Hobbes divided his time and thoughts between attention
to his health and to his studies. The morning he dedicated
to the first consideration—climbing the nearest hill as soon as
he got up; or, if the weather were bad, taking hard exercise
in the house as soon as he had finished his breakfast,—after
which meal he would make a circuit of the apartments, and
visit my lord, my lady, the children, and any distinguished
strangers that might be there, conversing for a short time with
all of them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Towards the end of his life he read few books, preferring,
he said, ‘to digest what he had already fed upon;’ ‘besides,’
he remarked, laughing, ‘if I were to read as much as most
men do, I should be as ignorant as they.’ In company he was
free in discourse, but could not brook contradiction, then he
was short and peevish; indeed it was usual, on admitting
strangers, to warn them not to vex the old man by differing
from him in argument. Hobbes, by his own testimony, was of
a timid nature. Kennet, the biographer of the Cavendishes,
from whose amusing volume we have drawn largely, says, ‘It
is not trampling on the ashes of the late Mr. Hobbes to say
he was a coward. He was constantly under apprehension of
messengers to arrest him, and that they would enter Chatsworth
or Hardwicke by force, and compel Lord Devonshire
to give him up.’</p>

<p class='c015'>Under the pressure of these fears he wrote an Apology for
himself and his writings, in which he affirmed that the doctrines
at which exception had been taken were not so much
his opinions as his suppositions, a delicate distinction enough.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>In his latter days Hobbes made an open profession of religion,
and frequented service in the chapel, often partaking of the
Holy Communion. If any one in conversation questioned his
belief, he would invariably allude to these practices, and refer
the speaker to the chaplain, who would bear testimony to his
orthodoxy. Some people thought this chapel-going was the
result of his wish to conform to the rules of the household, as
he never went to a parish church, and always turned his back
on the sermon, ‘for,’ said he, ‘they can teach me nothing
that I do not know.’ He had a perfect terror of being left to
himself in an empty house, and would always accompany the
family from Chatsworth to Hardwicke and back, however
weak and ill he might be. On the last occasion he journeyed
to Hardwicke on a feather bed in a coach, and the exertion
at so advanced an age hastened his death. He could not
endure the thought of dying, and had a new coat made when
on his deathbed, which, he hoped, would last him three years,
and then he would have another. He questioned the physician
at last whether his disease were curable, and on being
told he might hope for alleviation, but no cure—a fact which
his science and philosophy might surely have told him at
ninety-two years of age—he said, ‘Then I hope I shall find a
hole to creep out of the world.’</p>

<p class='c015'>They were his last words, and were somewhat ambiguous,
as ‘Hardwicke Hall, more glass than wall,’ could not well be
described as a ‘hole,’ with its lordly gallery, its noble staircase,
and its historical memories of Mary Queen of Scots, and
Arabella Stuart. Many of Hobbes’s most remarkable writings
are preserved there in manuscript.</p>

<p class='c015'>Our philosopher upheld the expediency of making use
of an evil instrument in an emergency, and said, ‘If I
had fallen into a well, and the devil let down his leg,
I would willingly lay hold of his cloven foot to haul myself
up by.’ He amused himself by making his friends write
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>provisional epitaphs for him, only one of which satisfied
him,—‘This is the true philosopher’s stone.’ Hobbes continued
studying and translating to the end of his life;
but Pope considered his rendering of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>
‘too mean for criticism.’ Although not very strong in
youth, Hobbes enjoyed excellent health on gaining middle
age. He was six feet high, of a fresh and ruddy complexion,
yellowish moustache, which turned up naturally after the
Cavalier fashion; with a tip, or ‘King Charles,’ under his lip,
being otherwise close shaven. He did not affect to look
severe, considering ‘heaviness of countenance no sign of
God’s favour, and a cheerful, charitable, upright behaviour
a better sign of religion than the zealous maintaining of controverted
opinions.’ He had always a book of ‘Prick Songs’
lying on the table, and at night, when every one in the house
was asleep, he would sing aloud,—not because he had a good
voice, but for the benefit of his lungs. Thomas Hobbes
appears to have been too much of a philosopher to have fallen
at any time under the spell of beauty; at least we can find no
mention in his <i>Memoirs</i> of even a passing subjugation to
female charms. Lord Clarendon speaks of him as ‘one of the
most ancient acquaintance I have in the world, whom I have
ever esteemed, not only for his eminent parts of learning, but
as a man of probity, and one whose life has been free from
scandal.’</p>

THE posthumous son of a small London tradesman,
his mother, although in straitened circumstances,
resolved to give her boy the
best education in her power; and she was rewarded
by living to see him rise to eminence
and distinction. Little Abraham one day,
sitting in the window seat in his mother’s home, found a volume
of Spenser’s <i>Faëry Queen</i> lying there. He opened the book,
and was soon absorbed in the contents, ‘sucking the sweet
honey of those inspired lines.’ He read, and re-read, and,
as Dr. Johnson tersely expresses it, became ‘irrecoverably a
poet.’</p>

<p class='c012'>His mother contrived to get him a nomination on the
foundation at Westminster School, where he soon became
remarkable for his powers of versification. At ten years old
he wrote the <i>Tragical History of Pyramus and Thisbe</i>, and
soon afterwards <i>Constantia and Philetus</i>, and before he was
fifteen a volume of his poems was actually published. In
1636 he went to the University of Cambridge, where, without
neglecting his studies, he continued his poetical pursuits,
and wrote a play called <i>Love’s Riddle</i>, which he dedicated
to Sir Kenelm Digby (the fashionable patron of the day), as
also a Latin comedy, inscribed to the Master of his College.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Cowley was expelled from Cambridge on account of his
adherence to the King’s party, and took shelter at St. John’s
College, Oxford. A satire which he wrote about this time,
entitled <i>The Puritan and the Papist</i>, gained him the favour
of the Royalists, and especially of Lord Falkland, who made
him known and welcomed at Court. When Queen Henrietta
Maria went to France, Cowley followed her fortunes, and,
becoming Secretary to Lord Jermyn, was employed in correspondence
of the most confidential nature, such as communications
between the Royalists in England and those in France,
and private letters between King Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> and his Queen.
He was indefatigable in his labours, and would cipher and
decipher far into the night, yet finding time for poetical compositions
in the midst of such arduous work. He produced
an amorous drama, entitled <i>The Mistress</i>, for he considered
that no man was worthy of the name of poet till he had paid
his tribute to Love.</p>

<p class='c012'>In 1656 he went over on a mission to England, to inquire
and report on the political state of affairs; but the Parliamentarians
were on his track, and he was thrown into prison,
and only set free on the payment of a considerable ransom,
which was generously advanced by a friend. He became a
Doctor of Medicine at Oxford, but does not appear to have
practised in that capacity, though in the early days of the
Royal Society, just founded at Oxford, and not yet translated to
London, the poet figured as ‘Dr. Cowley.’ He made a pilgrimage
to Kent, and in the fair fields of ‘England’s garden’
he studied botany, and gathered materials which led to the
composition of several Latin poems treating of trees, herbs,
and flowers, and their peculiar qualities.</p>

<p class='c012'>Cowley was destined to great mortification and disappointment
at the Restoration, being scarcely noticed by the King.
It is supposed that a faction had been formed against him,
by which his hopes of obtaining the Mastership of the Savoy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>that had been promised him both by Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> and his
father before him, were frustrated. The ill success of his
comedy, <i>The Guardian</i>, when put upon the stage, was another
source of mortification. There was a spiteful rumour
set about, that the drama was intended as a satire on the
Royalists, and the author was so discomfited, hearing of
its failure, that Dryden said he did not receive the news
with the calmness becoming so great a man. He wrote an
Ode, in which he designated himself as the ‘melancholy
Cowley,’ and this production brought down upon him a host
of squibs and lampoons, on the dejected ‘Savoy-missing
Cowley,’ and the like. Disgusted with the outer world, our
poet languished for the retirement of a country life, and
settled at Chertsey, in Surrey. His friends the Earls of Arlington
and St. Albans (whom he had served when Lord Jermyn)
procured him an office which brought in a certain salary, ‘but,’
says Johnson, ‘he did not live long to enjoy the pleasure, or
suffer the weariness, of solitude.’</p>

<p class='c012'>He died at Chertsey in 1667. He was the author of
numerous works, which are little read at the present day,
although the name of Abraham Cowley ranks high in literature.
He was at the University with Milton, but the two poets differed
as much in the quality of their writings as in the bias of their
political views. The Duke of Buckingham, on hearing the
news of Cowley’s death, said he had not left behind him
as honest a man in England. He erected a monument
to the poet’s memory in Westminster Abbey. We find in
John Evelyn’s Diary: ‘I heard the sad news of the death of
Abraham Cowley, that incomparable poet and virtuous man,
Aug. 1667.—Went to Cowley’s funerall, whose corpse lay at
Wallingford House, and was thence conveyed to Westminster
Abbey in a hearse with six horses, and all decency. Neere
a hundred coaches of noblemen and persons of qualitie
following; among these all the witts of the towne, divers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>bishops and cleargymen. He was interred neere Geoffrey
Chaucer and Spenser. A goodly monument is since erected
to his memorie.’ Sir William Cowper was much attached to
Cowley, and had his portrait painted especially for his own
gallery.</p>

THE son of a watchmaker, he was born at
Plymouth, and, like his illustrious fellow-townsman,
showed an early enthusiasm for
art, and a distaste for any other occupation.
But his father was prudent, and bound his
son apprentice to himself, allowing him no
money, and discouraging in every possible manner the boy’s
artistic tendencies. They were too strong to be repressed.
Young James gave all his spare time to the study of drawing,
and, having scraped together five guineas, he doubled the sum
by the sale of a print of the new assembly rooms and bathing-place
at Plymouth, from one of his own Indian ink sketches.
Armed with this large fortune, he plotted a secret journey to
London with his elder brother Samuel; his only confidants
being Dr. Mudge and a Mr. Tolcher, both Plymouth men,
and friends of Sir Joshua Reynolds, the newly-elected President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of the Royal Academy, to whom they gave James letters of
introduction. The brothers set forth on their pilgrimage one
fine May morning, being Whit-Sunday; and the younger tells
us that when they arrived on the hill and looked homewards,
Samuel felt some regret—James nothing but satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c015'>The travellers performed the whole of the journey on foot,
with a rare lift on the top of a stage-coach; sleeping wherever
they could: in small ale-houses, by the wayside, sometimes in
haylofts, and even under hedgerows. The new President
received the young aspirant with the greatest kindness, and
installed him in his own house. Samuel Northcote soon
returned home, but James wrote to a friend in Devonshire,
in raptures with his new domicile. ‘The house,’ he
says, ‘is to me a paradise; all the family behave with the
greatest kindness, especially Sir Joshua’s two pupils. Miss
Reynolds has promised to show me her paintings, for she
paints very fine, both history and portraits. Sir Joshua is
so much occupied that I seldom see him; but, when I find
him at liberty, I will ask his advice for future guidance,
and whether there will be any chance of my eventually
gaining a subsistence in London, by portrait-painting.’ The
master soon found out that his new pupil was earnest and
industrious, and it was arranged that Northcote should
remain in the President’s service for five years. The hall
in which he worked was adjacent to his master’s sitting-room,
and he was both amused and edified by overhearing
the conversations of such men as Burke, Johnson, Garrick,
etc. He worked diligently, copying Sir Joshua’s pictures,
studying the human form—drapery, etc.,—persuading the
housemaids to sit to him, and working as a student at the
Academy. He tells an amusing incident of Reynolds’s
favourite macaw, which had a violent hatred for one of the
maid-servants in the house, whom Northcote had painted.
It flew furiously at the portrait, pecking the face with its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>beak. We might be inclined to suspect the artist of inventing
this implied compliment to his own handiwork, were
we not also assured that Sir Joshua tried the experiment
of putting the portrait in view of the bird, who invariably
swooped down on the painted enemy. The maid’s crime, we
believe, consisted in cleaning out the cage.</p>

<p class='c015'>Northcote began to exhibit on his own account in 1774, and
became eventually A.R.A. and R.A. Samuel Northcote met
Sir Joshua on one of his visits to Plymouth, at the house of
their common friend, Dr. Mudge, and writes to his brother to
tell him the President had spoken of him in very satisfactory
terms. When the five years’ apprenticeship was nearly over,
Northcote took leave of his master. He gives rather a tedious
account of the interview, in which he announced his determination,
but ends the paragraph by saying ‘it was of course impossible
to leave a house, where he had received so much
kindness, without regret; it is a melancholy reflection, even at
this moment, when one considers the ravages a few short
years have made in that unparalleled society which shone at
his table, now all gone.’</p>

<p class='c015'>On leaving London, our painter went into Devonshire,
made some money by his portraits, and then proceeded to
Italy alone, ignorant, as he was, of one word of the language.
He spent his time in copying the Italian masters, more
especially the works of Titian; returned from Rome to England
<i>via</i> Flanders, and again had recourse to portrait-painting,
first in his native county, and afterwards in London, where
he settled. About this time the scheme for the Boydell
Shakespeare Gallery was started, making a great sensation,
and Northcote gained much κυδος for his contributions to that
work, more especially ‘The Princes in the Tower,’ which
furnished Chantry with the idea for his beautiful and touching
monument in Lichfield Cathedral. Northcote took great
delight in this work, as his bias had always led him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>historical and fancy subjects. His sacred pictures were not
much admired, and his plagiarism of Hogarth, which was a
species of parody on the great works of that great man, gained
him no popularity. An answer of his amused Sir Joshua
much, on one occasion. When the President asked him how it
chanced that the Prince of Wales so often mentioned him,
‘I was not aware you even knew him?’ ‘Well,’ replied
James, ‘I know very little of him, or he of me; it is only his
bragging way.’</p>

<p class='c015'>His conversations were sufficiently esteemed to be recorded
by Hazlitt, his friend and constant companion. By nature
Northcote was intelligent, energetic, and industrious; he
triumphed over the disadvantages of an imperfect education,
and knew how to benefit by his opportunities. We have
never read his Life of Sir Joshua, but by the numerous extracts
which Leslie and Taylor give us, it would appear he was
scarcely a worthy biographer of so great a man. He resided
for nearly half a century in Argyll Street, London, his sister
keeping his house, and died there in his eighty-sixth year,
leaving a good fortune, the product of his labours.</p>

DESCENDED from Robert Cowper, who, in the
reign of Henry <span class='fss'>V.</span>, in consideration of his
good services, received the sum of <i>sixpence
a day</i> for life out of the King’s rents in the
county of North Hants. William Cowper,
in the reign of Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span>, married Margaret,
daughter of Thomas Spencer, of St. Peter’s, Cornhill, and this
lady’s maiden name has been perpetuated in the Cowper
family to the present day.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir William, of whom we are treating, was grandson
of the above, and eldest surviving son of John Cowper
and Elizabeth Ironside of Lincoln, his wife, who had five
sons and four daughters. William succeeded his father, and
was seated at Ratling Court, in Kent. He was created a
Baronet of Nova Scotia, afterwards of England, and subsequently
knighted by King Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> at Theobalds. He
was also appointed Collector of Imposts on strangers in
the Port of London; and when the civil war began, being a
zealous Royalist, he was imprisoned in Ely House, Holborn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>together with his eldest son. But, says Collins, Sir William
outlived all his troubles, and went to dwell at his castle
at Hertford, where he gained the hearts of his neighbours
by the cordiality of his manners and his generous hospitality,
while his name was beloved in the country round
for the Christian acts of charity and kindness in which he
took delight. Neither was it the formal dispensation of alms
alone, for Sir William loved to visit and comfort his poorer
neighbours in their own dwellings. He married Martha,
daughter of John Masters, of East Langdon, county Kent,
and sister to Sir Edward Masters, Knight, by whom he had
six sons and three daughters. Sir William was buried in
the cloister of St. Michael’s, Cornhill, beside his parents, who
lie there beneath ‘a goodly monument.’</p>

<p class='c015'>Cornelius Jansen, who painted Sir William’s portrait, and
that of his son John, was a well-known Flemish painter, who
resided for many years in London, and afterwards in Kent,

sat to him.</p>

HE was the eldest son of Sir William Cowper, first
Baronet, by the sister of Sir Edward Masters,
Knight. He was entered at Lincoln’s
Inn as a law student, and married Martha,
daughter of John Hewkley of London,
merchant, by whom he had one son, William,
who succeeded his grandfather, and a daughter, who died
young. John Cowper was a staunch Royalist, and shared
his father’s captivity on that account. He died during his
imprisonment. The following letter, addressed to him, in the
year 1634, when on the point of starting for his travels,
appears to us worthy of insertion, from the manliness and
rectitude of its counsels, enhanced by the quaint diction
which marked the period:—</p>

<p class='c026'><i>Feb. 25, 1634.</i>—A remembrance to my Son, John Cowper, at his going towards y<sup>e</sup> Parts beyond y<sup>e</sup> Seas.</p>

THE son of John Cowper, by Martha Hewkley,
succeeded to the baronetcy and estates on
the death of his grandfather, served in the
last two Parliaments of Charles II., as
Member for Hertford; and, in 1680, presented
reasons (with many other Members
of both Houses) for the indictment of James, Duke of York,
for not coming to church. After the Revolution, he again
sat for Hertford in three different Parliaments. His wife was

HE was the second son of Sir William Cowper,
second Baronet, by the daughter of Sir Samuel
Holled, consequently the brother of William,
afterwards the first Lord Cowper; and we
have alluded, in the life of the Chancellor,
to the deep attachment which subsisted
between these two brothers. They were educated at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>school, selected the same profession, and, when travelling the
same Circuit, almost invariably inhabited the same lodgings.</p>

<p class='c034'>Sir William Cowper and his eldest son and namesake had
both been returned in 1695 for Hertford, after a sharp contest,
for the Tory element, though in the minority, was strong in
that borough. Among the most zealous of their supporters
was one Stout, a Quaker by creed, a maltster by trade; and he
had been most instrumental in furthering the election of father
and son. At all events, so thought Sir William, who did not
discontinue his friendly relations with the widow and only
daughter of Samuel Stout after the good Quaker’s death.
The two ladies were frequently invited to Sir William’s London
house in Hatton Garden, and the visit occasionally returned
at Mrs. Stout’s residence in the town of Hertford. Moreover,
Mistress Sarah, to whom her father had left a good fortune,
employed Spencer Cowper as her man of business, and consulted
him in all her financial concerns. Unfortunately it
soon became painfully evident to all concerned that this
beautiful, imaginative, and essentially excitable girl had formed
a deep attachment for the young lawyer, already the husband
of another woman.</p>

<p class='c034'>‘But he, like an honest man,’ says Lord Macaulay, ‘took
no advantage of her unhappy state of mind.’ A frightful catastrophe,
however, was impending. On the 14th March 1699,
the day after the opening of the Spring Assizes, the town and
neighbourhood of Hertford were thrown into a state of excitement
and consternation by the news that the body of Sarah
Stout had been found in the waters of the Priory river, which
flows through that town. Suspicion fell on Spencer Cowper,
on the poor plea that he was the last reported to have been
in her company; but his defence was so clear and satisfactory
on the inquest, that a verdict of suicide while in a
state of temporary insanity was recorded. William Cowper
was not attending the Assizes, his Parliamentary duties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>detaining him in London, but Spencer finished the Circuit,
in company with the judges, heavy-hearted indeed at the
sad fate of his pretty friend, but with no misgiving on his own
account. He little dreamed of the mischief which was hatching
by the political adversaries of the Cowper interest. A rumour
was carefully promulgated that Spencer had presumed on his
intimacy with the fair Quaker, and that Sarah had drowned
herself to conceal her disgrace. But this charge was proved
to be unfounded. The next step taken by those who wished
to render the name of Cowper obnoxious in Hertford, was
to revive the cry of ‘Murder’ against Spencer, on the plea
that the position in which the body had been found precluded
the possibility of the girl having thrown herself into
the water. Two ‘accomplices’ were carefully ferreted out,
in the persons of two attorneys, who had come down to
Hertford the day before the sad event; but these gentlemen
were left at large on bail, while the man, whose father and
brother at that moment represented Hertford, was thrown
into prison for months, to await the Summer Assizes.</p>

<p class='c034'>The distress of his parents, and of the brother who dearly
loved him, may be well imagined, more especially as they
were keenly alive to all the adverse influences which were at
work. When the eventful day of the trial at length arrived,
the town of Hertford—it might wellnigh be said the whole of
England,—was divided in favour of the Cowpers and the
Stouts; for so unwilling were the Quakers to let the imputation
of suicide rest on the memory of one of their members,
that they most earnestly desired to shift the blame on the
young barrister, or, as he afterwards said at his trial, to
risk bringing three innocent men to the gallows. We have
good authority for affirming that the most ignorant and
densest of judges, Baron Hatsel by name, sat on the bench
that day, and that the prosecution was remarkable for the
malignity with which it was conducted. Their winning card,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>as they believed, was the statement that the position in which
the corpse had been found floating, proved that the girl must
have been murdered before she had been thrown into the
water. Medical evidence was brought forward by the prosecution
in support of this theory, as also that of two or three
sailors, who were put into the box. On the side of the
defendant appeared names which still live in medical annals,—William
Cowper (although no kinsman of his namesake), the
most celebrated anatomist then in England, and Samuel Garth,
the great London physician and rival of Hans Sloane. After
what Macaulay terms ‘the superstitious testimony of the forecastle,’
Baron Hatsel asked Dr. Garth what he could say in
reply. ‘My Lord,’ answered the physician drily, ‘I say they
are mistaken. I could find seamen in abundance who would
swear that they have known whistling raise the wind.’</p>

<p class='c034'>This charge was disposed of; the body had drifted down to
the mill-dam, where it was discovered entangled and supported
by stakes, only a portion of the petticoat being visible. But
the evidence of a maid-servant of Mistress Stout produced
great excitement in Court. She told how the young barrister
had arrived at the house of her mistress the night before the
poor girl’s death; of how he had dined with the two ladies;
how she had gone upstairs to prepare his bed, as he was invited
to sleep, leaving the young people together, her mistress having
retired early; how, when upstairs, she heard the house-door
slam, and, going down to the parlour, found it empty. At first
she was not alarmed, thinking Mistress Sarah had gone out
for a stroll with Mr. Cowper, and would soon be back; but as
time went on, she became very uneasy, and went and told her
mistress. The two women sat up all night watching and
listening, but had not liked to take any further steps, out of
regard for Sarah’s reputation. They never saw her again till
she was brought up from the river drowned. Then followed
the ridiculous investigation of Cowper’s ‘accomplices,’ as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>were termed—two attorneys and a scrivener, who had come
down from London under very suspicious circumstances, <i>i.e.</i>
to attend the Assizes; how they were all in a room together
shortly after eleven o’clock, very wet, and in a great perspiration,
and had been overheard to say, ‘Mistress Stout had
behaved ill to her lover, but her courting days would soon
be over,’ to which communication was added the astounding
fact, that a piece of rope had been found in a cupboard adjoining
the sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c034'>It was fortunate for Spencer Cowper, who was not allowed
the assistance of counsel, that his legal education, joined to a
sense of conscious innocence, made his defence comparatively
easy to him; but the task, on all accounts, must have been most
distasteful and repugnant to a man of his character and position.
He rose with dignity, and evinced great skill and decision
of purpose in the manner in which he cross-examined the
witnesses, and exposed the motives of sectarian and political
animosity, which had been employed to weaken the interest of
Sir William Cowper and his eldest son. So far his arguments
were unhesitating,—he was now to be put to a harder test. He
assured the Court that he deeply deplored the course he was
compelled to take, but four lives were at stake, and he must,
however reluctantly, violate the confidence of the dead. He
brought many witnesses to substantiate the fact of the young
Quaker having cherished a fatal passion for him, although she
knew him to be married. When last in London, she had written
to announce her intention of visiting him at his chambers in the
Temple, to prevent which William Cowper had purposely said
in her hearing that Spencer had gone into the country on
business. Disappointed of this opportunity, Sarah wrote to
invite him to stay at her mother’s house at Hertford during the
Spring Assizes, which invitation he declined, having secured
lodgings in the town. He also produced letters in which the
poor girl said, ‘I am glad you have not quite forgotten there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>is such a person as myself,’ and, after hinting at what seemed
unkindness, she begs him ‘so to order your affairs as to be
here as soon as you can, which cannot be sooner than you
are welcome.’</p>

<p class='c034'>In another and later letter she was less ambiguous in her
expressions: ‘Come life, come death,’ she says desperately, ‘I
am resolved never to desert you.’ He further asserted that
the continual rebuffs she received threw her into a state of
melancholy, and that she often spoke of her intention to
destroy herself. The prisoner continued, that on the first day
of the Assizes he went first to his lodgings, but, unwilling
to mortify Sarah, afterwards to her mother’s house, and
stayed dinner; went out, and returned to supper; but when
the maid had gone upstairs, and he was alone with the girl,
although he declined detailing the conversation which ensued
between them, he gave the judge and jury to understand
that it was from consideration for her character that he left
the house, which he did alone, and returned to his lodgings
in the Market Place.</p>

<p class='c034'>The next morning the news of the terrible event reached
him. His brother William and his wife both testified to the
state of despondency into which Sarah had lately fallen, and
her frequent allusions to approaching death. As regarded
‘the accomplices,’ they gave good reasons for their coming
to Hertford, and, for himself, he had never had any communication
with them. The judge summed up in a vacillating
and illogical manner, confessing that he was rather faint,
and was sensible he had omitted many things, but could
repeat no more of the evidence. The half-hour which it took
the jury to deliberate must have seemed interminable to those
members of Cowper’s family, already nearly maddened by
suspense—above all, to the brother who sat near him, and
followed the details of the trial with breathless interest. The
jury returned, and, when the foreman answered the awful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>question, the prisoner was the one individual in Court who
manifested the least emotion as the words ‘Not guilty’
echoed through the building, and all but the enemies and
slanderers acknowledged the justice of the verdict. A feeble
attempt was made to bring all the four accused men to a
fresh trial, by what was then called an ‘appeal to murder,’ and
there were various hearings on the subject by men of the
highest standing in the law, William Cowper, on these
occasions, being counsel for his brother. The proceedings,
however, were quashed. Some scurrilous writings were published,
in hopes of setting the tide of public opinion against
Spencer, but they were soon forgotten. He pursued his profession,
in which he rose to eminence; but it may easily be
conjectured that, when presiding at a trial for murder, Judge
Cowper must have felt, even more than the generality of his
colleagues, the responsibility of his position, from an intimate
and personal sympathy with the feelings of an accused prisoner;
and he was remarked for his merciful tendencies. On the
accession of George <span class='fss'>I.</span>, he was named Attorney-General to
the Prince of Wales, was one of the managers on the trial of
Dr. Sacheverell for high treason, and successively Chief-Justice
of Chester, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Serjeant-at-Law,
and Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. He also sat
in Parliament for Truro, and his sister-in-law, Lady Cowper,
tells us that in 1714 the King gave M. Robethon (one of
his favourite German Ministers) the grant of Clerk of the
Parliament after the death of Mr. Johnson, who then held it,
for any one he liked to name. ‘M. Robethon let my brother
Cowper have it in reversion for his sons for £1800.’</p>

<p class='c034'>By his wife, Pennington, daughter of John Goodere,
Esq., Spencer had three sons,—William, John, and Ashley.
The official appointments above alluded to were held in
succession by the family for several years. He had also a
daughter, Judith, known as a poetess, married to Lieut.-Colonel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Madan. Spencer Cowper died at his chambers in
Lincoln’s Inn Fields, in 1728, and was buried at Hertingfordbury,
where an elaborate monument is erected to his memory.
He was grandfather to William Cowper the poet.</p>

HE was the eldest son of Sir William Cowper,
the second Baronet, by Sarah, daughter of
Sir Samuel Holled, merchant, of London,
and was born at Hertford Castle. He went
to school at St. Albans, and seems to have
been of a most docile disposition, to judge
by a letter written to his mother when only eight years old.
He says: ‘I thank you for my bow and arrows, which I
shall never use but when my master gives us leave to play. I
shall hereafter take more care of my spelling and writing,
even without ruled lines.’</p>

<p class='c035'>His childish letters were written in a fair hand, giving
promise of the beautiful writing for which the future Lord
Chancellor was famed, and were addressed with much
punctilio, ‘These for my ever honoured mother, the Lady
Cowper, at her house in the Charter-House Yard, London.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The boy took great pains, not only with his writing, but
with his style, so much so as to cause a suspicion in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>mother’s mind that one of the epistles was dictated by an
usher, an insinuation which the young student repelled with
some asperity. It seems doubtful whether he ever went to a
public school, and certainly he never entered a University;
but at eighteen he became a Templar, giving himself up
rather to pleasure than study in these first years of a London
life. He formed a connection with a Miss Culling of
Hertingfordbury, by whom he had two children. This <i>liaison</i>
was much talked of, and by many it was reported he had
married her, a circumstance which caused him much annoyance
at a later period. In 1686 he became attached to one
Mistress Judith Booth, wise and beautiful, but poor withal,
in consequence of which his family opposed the marriage.
His father was in the prime of life, and had other children to
provide for; but, in spite of all opposition, the wedding took
place, and the young husband became studious and steady
from the pressure of domestic responsibility. He writes an
amusing letter to his wife, describing his maiden motion in
the Court of King’s Bench, and tells her that he was blamed
for not interweaving enough ‘May it please your Lordships’
and the like urbanities in his speech, adding, ‘but I will
amend in future, and you shall find me begin to practise
extraordinary civilities on your sweet self.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The precepts and example of Sir William Cowper had instilled
principles of political liberality in the young lawyer’s
mind which made him regard with disapprobation and anger
many of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>’s (public) proceedings, towards the latter
part of his reign, and still more so those of his successor,
added to which considerations the Cowper family were rigid
Protestants; and thus it came about that when the Prince of
Orange landed in England, the brothers William and Spencer
hastily raised a small body of volunteers, and set forth, with
more than a score of young gentlemen of the same political
tendencies, to join William.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>In a diary he sent to his wife, Cowper gives an amusing
description of how he fell in with the Prince at Wallingford,
at a small inn, where he saw him ‘dine with a great variety of
meats, sauces, and sweetmeats, which, it seems, is part of the
fatigue we admire so much in great generals!’</p>

<p class='c035'>He travelled with the Prince to Windsor, where they were
received with unfeigned pleasure; and he speaks of the new
face of the Court, ‘where there is nothing of the usual affectation
of terror, but extreme civility to all sorts of people, and
country women admitted to see the Prince dine.’ He does
not mention a circumstance which befell in this journey;
but his daughter, Lady Sarah, who had the particulars from
her uncle Spencer, proudly records an instance of her
father’s gallantry:—On the bridge at Oxford, the small
regiment of Hertfordshire volunteers found one of the arches
broken down, and an officer, with three files of musketeers,
who presented arms, and asked who they were for. There was
a silence, as the volunteers did not know to which side their
questioners belonged. ‘But my father,’ says Lady Sarah,
‘was quite unconcerned, and, spurring his horse forward, he
flung up his hat, crying, “The Prince of Orange,” which was
answered by a shout, for they were all of the same mind.’</p>

<p class='c035'>When the new King no longer required his services, Cowper
resumed his profession with diligence and zeal. He writes to
his wife to express his regret at not being able to stay with
her in the country; but, had he done so, he would throw himself
out of the little business he had.</p>

<p class='c035'>Another time he writes from Kingston, giving an account
of his having achieved a journey through the Sussex ways
(which are ruinous beyond imagination) without hurt. ‘I vow
’tis a melancholy consideration that mankind should inhabit
such a heap of dirt.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Campbell tells us, writing from Abinger Hall in 1845,
‘that it is a still common expression in that part of Surrey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>that those who live on the south side of Leith Hill are in the
dirt.’ Cowper contrasts the damp undrained tracts of Sussex
with the fine champaign country of Surrey, dry and dusty,
‘as if you had shifted in a few hours from winter to mid-summer.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The lawyer was rising gradually to great estimation in his
profession, and his friend Lord Chancellor Som&#x305;ers suggested
to him to go into Parliament, believing he would be most
serviceable to the Whig party. When the elections took place
in 1695, the Whigs were in the ascendant, and both Sir
William Cowper and his eldest son were returned for Hertford,
the Quakers being their chief supporters.</p>

<p class='c035'>Young Cowper’s maiden speech gave promise (afterwards
well fulfilled) of his qualifications as a debater. He was in
great favour at Court, and, being raised to the rank of King’s
Counsel, distinguished himself by his eloquence in the prosecution
of more than one State prisoner. During the trial
of Lord Mohun, for the murder of Richard Coote, Cowper
received a tribute for the clearness and excellence of his voice,
a quality for which, in after times, he became proverbial.
Several of the Lords, whose patience was being sorely tried
by the confused, indistinct tones in which the Solicitor-General
summed up, moved that some one with a good voice,
‘particularly Mr. Cowper,’ should be heard,—a great compliment
to the gentleman, although the motion was overruled.
The Cowper family, and Sir William’s eldest son in particular,
seemed in the good graces of fortune, until the untoward
event occurred which threw all those who bore the name
into distress and perplexity, being, namely, the charge
of murder against Spencer Cowper, as already recorded in
our notice of his life. He and his brother were much
attached, were members of the same profession, and travelled
the same Circuit—in fact, were almost inseparable
companions.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>The justice of Spencer Cowper’s acquittal was unquestionable,
yet the popular feeling ran so high in the town and
neighbourhood, especially among the community of which the
unfortunate girl was a member, that it was clear to every one
that no candidate bearing the name of Cowper would be
successful at the next election. Sir William indeed retired
from Parliamentary life altogether, and his eldest son having
failed in his canvass for Totness, in Devon (for which place
he had stood by the wish and advice of his friend and patron,
Lord Som&#x305;ers), he was fain to take refuge in the close borough
of Berealstone, which he represented until intrusted with the
Great Seal. William <span class='fss'>III.</span> died, and Queen Anne reigned in his
stead, ascending the throne with feelings most inimical to the
Whig party. Affairs did not look promising for William
Cowper, all the more so as Lord Som&#x305;ers had fallen into great
disfavour; but he weathered the storm, and when the general
election in 1705 resulted in a majority for the Whigs, the
Great Seal of England was transferred from the hands of Sir
Nathan Wright to those of William Cowper. He had for
some time been looked upon as leader in the House of
Commons, where his agreeable manners and graceful address
had made him personally popular. As in the case of his
brother, slander had been busy with his name, and the report
that he had married two wives (of which circumstance hereafter)
had been widely circulated. But he had powerful
friends at Court in the Duchess of Marlborough and Lord
Treasurer Godolphin; and her Majesty listened to their
recommendations and her own bias in his favour, and
William Cowper kissed hands at Kensington Palace on his
appointment as Lord Keeper of the Great Seal.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘The youngest Lord Keeper,’ says his daughter, Lady
Sarah (he was in his forty-first year), ‘on record.’ ‘He looked
very young, and wearing his own hair made him appear
more so, which the Queen observing, obliged him to cut it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>off, remarking, it would be said she had given the Seals to a
boy.’</p>

<p class='c035'>It was about this time he contracted his second marriage;
he had sorely mourned for the death of his wife Judith, and
her child, but the charms of a fair client had made a deep
impression on his heart. Mary, daughter of John Clavering,
Esq. of Chopwell, county Durham (a gentleman of Tory
principles), was handsome, as we see from Kneller’s portrait—sensible,
and intelligent, as we gather from her charming
diary.</p>

<p class='c035'>The marriage was at first kept secret, which seems unaccountable,
as the lady was well born, well bred, and of
great personal charms. But she herself gives us a clue to the
mystery. The Lord Keeper was still young, very handsome,
in a high position, with every prospect of advancement, and
the eyes of many a Court beauty were turned on him as a
desirable match. We have enlarged on all the intrigues that
were carried on to prevent his union with his ‘dear rogue’ (as
he fondly calls her in one of his letters) in the notice of Lady
Cowper; suffice it to say that the sequel proved how
excellent had been his choice. But he did not allow
domestic happiness to interfere with official duties. He set
himself, with the advice of Lord Som&#x305;ers, to bring about
reforms on many points in the Court of Chancery, and,
above all, he took a step which met with the highest approbation
among all but the few, who aspired to the dignity he had
already attained; he abolished the custom of New Year’s
gifts. For many years it had been expected of every person
connected with the Court of Chancery to present the Lord
Keeper or Lord Chancellor with gifts of provisions and
wine. But latterly money had been substituted for these
minor donations, and hundreds, and sometimes thousands,
had been presented to the great official on the 1st of
January.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Lady Cowper tells us a laughable story of Lord Chancellor
Nottingham (who spoke with a lisp). He used to stand by
his table on New Year’s Day, for the better reception of the
moneys, and every time he laid a fresh sum on the table he
cried aloud, ‘O tyrant cuthtom!’</p>

<p class='c035'>But before the advent of the year 1706, the Lord Keeper
had it intimated to all those whom it might concern that the
practice was abolished, having first, as (he considered) in
duty bound, apprised the Prime Minister, Lord Godolphin, of
his intention. In spite of his prohibition, some gifts appeared
on the day in question, which were refused. He says in his
Diary: ‘New Year’s gifts turned back. I pray God it do
me more good than hurt.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Now Lord Campbell, while praising the Lord Keeper’s
magnanimity, accuses him of wanting the courage of his
opinions; and, finding he had raised a storm amongst all the
heads of all the departments that had benefited by this
‘tyrant custom’ of present-giving, implied he had done it
in part unintentionally. If this be so, we know at least, and
that from his wife’s diary, that on his second assumption
of office, he adhered to his determination; for,—as to the
people who presented these gifts, ‘it looked like insinuating
themselves into the favour of the Court; and if it was not
bribery, it looked too like it.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Of the Lord Keeper’s disinterestedness in money matters,
and his liberality, especially where men of talent were concerned,
there can be no doubt. Colley Cibber tells us that
when Sir Richard Steele’s patent as Governor of the Theatre
Royal passed the Great Seal, Lord Cowper steadily refused
all fees.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘Cowper managed the Court of Chancery with impartial
justice and great despatch, and was very useful in the House
of Lords in the promotion of business.’ So far Burnet’s
testimony. He was chosen one of the Lords Commissioners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>for England on the occasion of the Union with Scotland, and,
being next in rank to the Archbishop of Canterbury (who did
not attend), he occupied a most prominent post at the daily
conferences. Lord Campbell tells us that, by his insight into
character, and his conciliatory manners, he succeeded wonderfully
in soothing Caledonian pride and in quieting Presbyterian
jealousy. He regained his seat at Hertford in spite
(as he thought, at least) of Lord Harley’s machinations; for
between him and that Minister there was no love lost,
although Harley had an exalted opinion of the Lord
Keeper’s abilities. He was at this time in the Queen’s confidence,
who sent for him one day to her closet, in order to
consult him on the choice of a Chief Baron for Ireland. ‘I
observed it was difficult to find a fit man; but it was
obviously the interest of England to send over as many
magistrates as it was possible from hence, being the best
means to preserve the dependency of that country on
England.’ The Queen said she understood that they had a
mind to be independent if they could, but that they should
not. Verily ‘l’histoire se rêpête de jour en jour.’ He was
now raised to the peerage as Baron Cowper of Wingham,
county Kent, and was deputed to offer the thanks of Parliament
to his friend, the Duke of Marlborough, for his late
victory at Ramilies.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Act of Union appointed there should be one Great
Seal for the United Kingdom, although a Seal should still be
kept in Scotland for things appertaining to private right, and
Lord Cowper was declared by the Queen in Council to be the
first Lord Chancellor of Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c035'>This was in May 1707. In the general election of 1708
the Whigs gained a decided majority, and Cowper’s enemy,
Harley, retired; while his friend, Lord Som&#x305;ers, was made
President of the Council. Shortly after the famous trial of
Dr. Sacheverell, at which the Lord Chancellor presided, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Whig Ministry resigned, and the Tories returned to power.
Every endeavour was made by Harley and the Queen herself
to induce Lord Cowper to retain office. He was subjected to
the greatest importunity, in spite of his repeated refusals, and
his repugnance ‘to survive his colleagues.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He was actually followed down to Cole Green, ‘my place
in Hertfordshire (where I had gone to visit my wife, who had
lately lain in),’ by emissaries of the new Minister, and when he
waited on her Majesty to resign the Seal in person, the Queen
persisted in her refusal to receive it, and forced Lord Cowper
to ‘take it away and think the matter over till the morrow.’ He
returned unaltered in his decision, and Lord Campbell, from
whom we quote so largely, says ‘he withdrew from her
presence, carrying with him, what was far more precious than
this badge of office, the consciousness of having acted honourably.’
Lord Cowper now sought quiet in his country house,
but even here he was assailed by Swift’s abuse, and subjected
to stormy visits from the Duchess of Marlborough, who came
there more especially to vent her spleen by abuse of Queen
Anne. Now Lord Cowper had opposed the Duke of Marlborough
on more than one point when he considered his
ambition overweening, but he was sincerely attached both to
him and to his wife, and when the Duke and Duchess were
attacked, their faithful friend raised his voice and pen in behalf
of these ex-favourites. Lord Som&#x305;ers was growing infirm, and
Lord Cowper now led the Opposition in the House of Lords,
where the Queen said she hoped he would still serve her. He
replied he would act in the same manner as he would have
done had he continued in the same office, to which her kindness
had appointed him; and he kept his word.</p>

<p class='c035'>He strove hard to deter his Royal mistress from what many
in that day considered an unconstitutional proceeding, namely
the creation of Peers for the special purpose of carrying a
measure or strengthening a party—at least, so we gather from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>the Queen’s remark, ‘He was pleased to say to me he considered
the House of Lords full enough!’ in spite of which
remark twelve new peers of Tory tendencies took their seats a
few days afterwards, who were facetiously asked if they would
vote by their foreman. Lord Cowper never let an opportunity
pass of paying a tribute to his aged friend, Lord Som&#x305;ers;
and we find a well-timed and two-sided compliment to Sir
Isaac Newton, appointed by that nobleman to the Mastership
of the Mint. Lord Cowper thanked the great philosopher for
one of his scientific works written in Latin, and goes on to say,
‘I find you have taken occasion to do justice to that truly
great man, my Lord Som&#x305;ers, but give me leave to say the
other parts of the book which do not appear to concern him
are a lasting instance, among many others, to his clear
judgment in recommending the fittest man in the whole kingdom
to that employment.’ It was about this time that the
feud between Oxford (Harley) and Bolingbroke (St. John) was
at its height, the former still continuing his overtures to Cowper
to coalesce, when the Gordian knot was cut asunder by the
shears of Atropos. The Queen’s dangerous illness was announced,
and the Treasurer’s staff wrested from Oxford’s
grasp, and consigned by the dying sovereign into the hands of
the Duke of Shrewsbury, who burst into the Cabinet while
sitting, accompanied by the Duke of Argyll, with the important
news that Oxford was dismissed, and Bolingbroke called upon
to form a Ministry. Great confusion prevailed; all Privy
Councillors were summoned to attend, and Lords Cowper
and Som&#x305;ers (both fast friends to the Hanoverian succession)
repaired to Kensington Palace to make preparations for the
reception of the new monarch—for Queen Anne had breathed
her last.</p>

<p class='c035'>On the accession of George <span class='fss'>I.</span> Lords Justices were
appointed by the Regency Act for the administration of the
Government till the arrival of the King. The Whig Lords
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>outnumbered the Tories, and Cowper was their guiding spirit.
Their first measure was to name Joseph Addison secretary,
and respecting this appointment a laughable story is told.
Being directed to draw up an official statement of the death of
Queen Anne, the great author was so deeply impressed with
the responsibility of his situation, and so overwhelmed by a
choice of words, that the Lords Justices lost all patience, and
directed a common clerk to do the business. No change took
place in the Government offices till the arrival of George from
Hanover, with the exception of Lord Bolingbroke, ‘the Pretender’s
friend,’ who was summarily dismissed. Lord Cowper,
being one of those intrusted with this duty, and the recently
appointed Treasurer, found the very doors of his office locked
against him.</p>

<p class='c035'>No sooner did George <span class='fss'>I.</span> arrive from Hanover than the
Whigs returned to power. Lord Cowper was summoned to
the Royal presence, and the Great Seal once more intrusted
to that worthy keeping.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘The King was pleased to say he was satisfied with the
character he had heard of me, and so I replied that I accepted
the post with the utmost gratitude, and would serve his
Majesty faithfully, and, as far as my health would allow,
industriously.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The Prince of Wales was in the outer room, and very cordial
in his manner to the new Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p class='c035'>On the 20th October 1714, the King was crowned, and
Lord and Lady Cowper were both present. The lady had
translated for the King’s benefit (seeing he knew no English) a
memorial written by her lord, and entitled <i>An Impartial History
of Parties</i>, decidedly in favour of Whig principles, which
strengthened his Majesty’s predilection for his Chancellor;
and indeed both husband and wife stood in high favour at
Court, Lady Cowper having just been named Lady of the
Bedchamber to the Princess of Wales. Now the King, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>he had long looked forward to the possession of the English
Crown, had never given himself the trouble to learn English,
while Cowper had neither French nor German,—a circumstance
which was productive of some difficulties in the new Parliament.
The King’s ignorance and natural awkwardness were all the
more distasteful to those who had been accustomed (we quote
Lord Campbell’s words) ‘to the late Queen’s graceful delivery,
scarcely excelled by what we ourselves so warmly admire.’</p>

<p class='c035'>But could the voice of the last Queen-Regnant, though
‘it charmed all ears,’ rival for one moment those tones—to be
heard, alas! so seldom now—which used to ring, clear and
distinct as a silver bell, from one end of the House to the
other, where the loud overstrained accents of angry men are
so often inaudible?</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1715 the Lord Chancellor acted as High Steward on
the trial of the Jacobite Lords, ‘much,’ says Lady Cowper,
‘to my husband’s vexation and mine.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Winton, one of the prisoners, tried the Lord
Steward’s patience so sorely by frivolous delays and impediments
to the despatch of business, that Cowper, forgetting his
usual equanimity, answered with some harshness, upon which
Winton cried out, ‘I hope, my Lords, we are not to have
what in my country is called Cowper Justice; that is, hang
a man first, and try him afterwards.’ The Lord Steward was
too dignified to vouchsafe an answer, but the sally caused
some unseemly merriment in Court, and the saying ‘Cowper
Justice’ was often quoted in after days by his enemies. He
presided on several State trials, that of the ex-Minister Harley,
Earl of Oxford, and others. About this period of his career
a charge was brought against him of unfairness in the appointment
and dismissal of magistrates, but his faithful secretary
and expounder, Mary Cowper, came once more to his aid
by translating his vindication for the King’s perusal. He
writes to her on the subject—</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>‘My dear, here is the postscript which I hope may soon
be turned into French. I am glad to hear that you are well,
which upon tryall I find myself too. Dear Rogue, yours ever
and always.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The proceedings were stopped, but the days of Cowper’s
public life were numbered. Many intrigues had been at
work among his political opponents, to induce, worry, or
persuade the Lord Chancellor to vacate the Woolsack, but
his wife’s diary lets us completely behind the scenes. She says,
‘My Lord fell ill again, which occasioned a report that he
was about to resign; some said he had not health to keep in,
others that the Lords of the Cabinet Council were jealous of
his great reputation, which was true, for they had resolved to
put Chief-Justice Parkes in his place.’ The lady goes on to
say that her ‘disputes and arguments were the chief reason of
his staying in,’ and how she ‘took three weeks to prevail on
her Lord to remain.’ But the friendship that existed between
the Prince and Princess of Wales and Lord and Lady Cowper
was very disadvantageous to the latter pair, as regarded the
favour of the Sovereign, for at this juncture the Royal father and
son were at daggers drawn, so that it was difficult for any one to
keep friends with both sides. Doubtless worry and perplexity
of all kinds tended to increase the indisposition of the Lord
Chancellor, for his wife now gave up all idea of pressing him
to remain in office. She told him ‘that if it were any pleasure
to him she would retire into the country, and never repent
the greatest sacrifice she could make.’ And unquestionably
it appeared that it would have been a sacrifice, for Mary
Cowper was eminently fitted for a Court life, although her
patience and forbearance were often sorely tried, as we gather
from her diary. It is almost impossible to avoid occasional
repetition, as the notices of husband and wife are naturally
interwoven, though we have endeavoured to disentangle them.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Chancellor was beset with importunities to exchange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>his post for that of President of the Council. He replied
he would resign if they found a better man to fill his place,
but he would never change the duties of which he could
acquit himself with honour for such as he could not perform
at all—a resolution we strongly recommend to the consideration
of more modern statesmen.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Cowper’s Diary.—‘The Prince says, there is no one
in whom he has any confidence but my husband, and the King
says Lord Cowper and the Duke of Devonshire are the only
two men he has found trustworthy in the kingdom!’ But for
all that, there seems little doubt that his Majesty, to whose
ear birds of the air carried every matter, was not best pleased
with the constant allusions made in conversation between the
Prince of Wales and the Lord Chancellor to a future time,
and all that was then to be done, when another head would
wear the crown. Lord Cowper, writing to his wife from
Hertfordshire, excuses himself for not attending Court, ‘as my
vacations are so short, and the children require the presence
of one parent at least; your sister is prudent, but they do not
stand in awe of her, and there was no living till the birch was
planted in my room.’—<i>September 1716.</i> The opposition
which Lord Cowper offered to a proposed Bill, the passing of
which would have made the Prince dependent on his father
for income, put the finishing touch to his unpopularity with
George <span class='fss'>I.</span>, although the Lord Chancellor wrote a letter (in
Latin, the only language they understood in common) to his
Majesty, to explain his views.</p>

<p class='c035'>On the 15th April 1718, Lord Cowper resigned the Great
Seal at the same time that he kissed hands on his elevation to
an earldom. We cannot resist inserting in this place a tribute
which was paid the Minister, though it was not published till
after his death: ‘His resignation was a great grief to the well
affected, and to dispassionate men of both parties, who knew
that by his wisdom and moderation he had gained abundance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>of friends for the King; brought the clergy into better temper,
and hindered hot, over-zealous spirits from running things into
dangerous extremes.’ This, be it remembered, was written of
one who had gone to his account, of no living patron who could
benefit the writer. He now retired to his house at Cole Green,
and busied himself in improving and beautifying his gardens
and pleasure-grounds. Here he received many congratulations
on being (as a <i>protégé</i> of his, one Hughes, a poet, expresses
it) ‘eased of the fatigue and burthen of office.’</p>

<p class='c035'>But, though Lord Cowper had felt the strife and contention
of parties to be most irksome, yet he was so accustomed to
official life, that he continued to take a deep interest in all
the measures that were brought before the country. He
strenuously supported the Test and Corporation Acts, and as
vigorously opposed Lord Sunderland’s famous Peerage Bill,
which proposed that the existing number of English Peers
should never be increased, with exception in favour of
Princes of the blood-royal, that for every extinction there
should be a new creation; and, instead of sixteen elective
Scotch Peers, the King should name twenty-five to be hereditary.
A glance at the works of Sir Bernard Burke, Ulster
King-at-Arms, and his <i>collaborateurs</i>, will be the best proof
that Sunderland’s Bill was thrown out. Amongst those who
were the most violent in the denunciation of this measure,
were the wives and daughters of members in the House of
Commons, who were supposed to have been instrumental (as
we may believe from more recent experience) in influencing
the votes of their relatives. We mention this circumstance
as bearing in some degree on our subject. In the beginning
of 1722 an incident occurred which was differently construed
by the admirers and detractors of the ex-Chancellor.</p>

<p class='c035'>On the 3d February, the House of Lords having assembled,
the absence of the reigning Lord Chancellor, as likewise that
of the Lord Chief-Justice, was remarked, and much difficulty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>arose as to the proceeding of the House. Lord Cowper, most
indignant at the defalcation of his successor, moved that the
Duke of Somerset, the peer of highest rank present, should
occupy the Woolsack, and, on his refusal, further proposed
that course to the Duke of Kingston and Lord Lechmere; but
the discussion was put an end to by the arrival of the
Chancellor, in most undignified and hot haste, full of excuses
of having been detained by his Majesty, and of apologies
to their Lordships for having kept them waiting. Lord
Cowper, and several of his way of thinking, were not so easily
appeased, and one of them moved that the House, to show its
indignation, should adjourn till Monday next without transacting
any further business. The motion was negatived, but
Lord Cowper and his friends signed a protest, which went to
say, that the excuses which had been alleged seemed inadequate
to justify the indignity offered to the House,—‘undoubtedly
the greatest council in the kingdom, to which
all other councils should give way, and therefore no other
business ought to have detained the Chancellor,’ etc.; ‘also, we
venture to say, the dignity of this House has not of late years
been increasing, so we are unwilling that anything that we consider
to be a gross neglect of it should pass without some note on
our records.’ We cannot help alluding to this curious circumstance,
as it bears so strongly on the state of party feeling at the
time, and of Lord Cowper’s individual feelings in particular.</p>

<p class='c035'>The exiled Royal family had on several occasions applied to
him for his support and assistance, and, although he had
treated the communications with neglect and refusal, yet his
enemies were industrious in setting rumours abroad prejudicial
to the ex-Chancellor’s loyalty to the house of Hanover.
Layer (afterwards executed for conspiracy) had brought in his
name when examined before a Committee of the House of
Commons, which was, for the most part, only too ready to
listen to any slander against the ex-Minister.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Lord Cowper entered a protest in the Parliamentary
Journal, that the charges brought against him in this matter
were false, ‘upon his honour,’ the usual oath of a Peer. He
manfully opposed the Bill for the banishment of Bishop
Atterbury, who was voted guilty of high treason without
a hearing. ‘The alleged culprit,’ he says, ‘stands at your
bar, and has never attempted to fly from justice. If there be
legal evidence against him, let him be legally convicted;
without legal evidence he must be wrongly condemned.’</p>

<p class='c035'>After much more in the same forcible strain, he continues,
‘I can guess at no other advantage that the Church can
derive from this Bill, except that it will cause a vacancy
in the Deanery of Westminster and the See of Rochester.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Campbell quotes a saying of Lord Bathurst on the
same debate, which is worth recording. He ‘could not
account for the inveterate malice which some people bore
to the learned and ingenious Bishop, unless possessed of the
infatuation of the wild Indians, who believe they will not only
inherit the spoils but also the abilities of the enemy they kill.’
But, in spite of eloquence and sarcasm, Bishop Atterbury was
banished. Cowper’s last public act was to vote against Sir
Robert Walpole’s Bill for the imposition of a heavy tax on the
estates of the Roman Catholics. This proposed injustice he
strenuously opposed, one of his chief arguments being as
follows: ‘I beg your Lordships to reflect if you are not
yourselves injuring the Protestant cause, for Protestants
might have severe hardships inflicted on them abroad, by
reason of our persecution of Roman Catholics at home.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The remainder of his life was passed between Cole Green
and London. As we have before observed, he superintended
the management of his estate, presided over the education of
his children, and enjoyed the society of his friends; but his
letters go to prove that the interest he still took in public affairs
preponderated over that he felt in the pursuits of a country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>life. He was too often deprived of the consolation of his
wife’s presence in his Hertfordshire home, in consequence of
her close attendance on the Princess of Wales. He writes to
her most affectionately, and gives her excellent advice, such
as, ‘If you discern that any at your Court are sowing seeds that
will raise strife, I hope you will do your best to root ‘em
out; and when you have so done your duty, you will have
more reason to be unconcerned at the event, if it should be
unfortunate. Though, when you have done so well, I would
not have you so much as hope that there are not some who
will represent you as an intolerable mischief-maker. I thank
you for your endearing and, I depend, very sincere expressions;
but, considering all things, I think it is but reasonable that
you should find something more satisfactory in a Court than
you can in the home of a retired Minister—who, you know,
is always a peevish creature—and so solitary a place. The
Attorney-General puts me in mind of the choice by which
they generally try idiots: it is to see if they will choose an
apple before a piece of gold. It is cruel to tantalise a poor
country man with the life of state and pleasure you describe.
I could be content as I am if I did not hear of such fine
doings.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He thinks the best way, ‘since we neither beat nor fine
our servants, is to make them so content that they will fear
being turned away. John’s drunkenness seems a tertian,
having one sober day between two drunken ones. On Friday
it proved quotidian.’ He finds ‘the country pleasant,’ but it
dulls him, and he takes an aversion to all but the little ones
of the place. The last letter he ever wrote to his wife was
dated from London, she being at Cole Green, one week
before his death—the fine handwriting, much impaired. He
complains to his dearest Mary, ‘that man and wife cannot
correspond with innocent and proper freedom, without its
being a diversion to a third person,’ and he signs himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>after promising to be with her soon, ‘yours with perfect
affection.’ He returned home on the day appointed, but he
had caught cold on his journey thither, and was seized with
an alarming illness. Happily his wife was by his bedside to
minister to his necessities, with all the tenderness of devoted
affection; his children, too, whom he so much loved, were
with him. When told that he had not long to live, Lord
Cowper listened calmly, and his death was composed and
peaceful. He was buried in the parish church of Hertingfordbury,
but no tablet marks the last resting-place of William,
Earl Cowper, first Lord Chancellor of Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Campbell, in the interesting Life from which we have
so largely quoted, speaks of those who praised him and those
who maligned him. Swift, who had no call to be severe in
matters of morality, and his friend Mrs. Manley, had been
very instrumental in promulgating the slander respecting a
clandestine marriage between Cowper and the young lady
of whom he was guardian,—a charge which was so often
repeated that it gained credit among some of his political
enemies, at least, who gave him the nickname of ‘Will
Bigamy.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The great Voltaire, in his <i>Philosophical Dictionary</i>, does
not disdain to assure his readers that the English Lord
Chancellor not only practised, but wrote a pamphlet in
favour of, polygamy! ‘Il est public en Angleterre, et on
voudroit le nier en vain, que le Chancellier Cowper, épousa
deux femmes, qui vécurent ensemble dans sa maison, avec
une concorde singulière, qui fit honneur à tous les trois.’
This was one of the observations made by the great French
philosopher, when he was so obliging as to come over for the
purpose of studying our manners and customs; but Lord
Cowper was rich in panegyrists both in prose and verse—the
latter effusions, to our taste, too stilted and artificial,
for the most part, to be worthy of insertion; but a passage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>from a paper in the <i>Spectator</i> is a graceful and characteristic
tribute to his many gifts:—</p>

<p class='c035'>‘It is Lord Cowper’s good fortune ever to please and to be
pleased; wherever he comes, to be admired, or is absent, to
be lamented. His merit fares like the pictures of Raphael,
which are seen with admiration, or at least no one dare own
he has no taste for a composition which has received so
universal an applause. It is below him to catch the sight by
any care of dress; he is always the principal figure in the
room. He first engages your sight, as if there were stronger
light ‘upon him than on any other person. Nothing can equal
the pleasure of hearing him speak but the satisfaction one
receives in the civility and attention he pays to the discourse
of others.’ So far the <i>Spectator</i>: his character, drawn in the
<i>Historical Register</i>, speaks in the most glowing terms of his
eminence as a lawyer, civilian, and statesman, and winds up
with these words: ‘a manly and flowing eloquence, a clear,
sonorous voice, a gracious aspect, and an easy address; in a
word, all that is necessary to form a complete orator.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The Duke Wharton, speaking of him in his official capacity,
says, ‘He had scarcely presided in that high station for one
year before the scales became even, with the universal approbation
of both parties.’ Lord Chesterfield, although there was
a little sting mixed with the praise, records ‘his purity of style,
his charm of elocution, and gracefulness of action. The ears
and eyes gave him up the hearts and understandings of his
audience.’ We would merely add that if to any reader of
these pages such praise should appear in any way exaggerated,
we must remind them they were all written after there was no
more to be hoped from the gratified vanity of Lord Cowper.
His trust and humility as a Christian are testified by an entry
in his Diary, on his appointment as Lord Keeper: ‘During
these great honours done me, I often reflected on the
uncertainty of them, and even of life itself. I searched my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>heart, and found no pride and self-conceit in it; and I begged
God that He would preserve my mind from relying on the
transient vanity of the world, and teach me to depend only
on His providence, that I should not be lifted up by
present success, or dejected when the reverse should happen.
And verily, I believe, I was helped by His Holy Spirit.’</p>

<p class='c035'>When the reverse did come, he added, ‘Glory be to God,
who has sustained me in adversity, and carried me through
the malice of my enemies, so that all designed for my hurt
turned to my advantage.’ It is evident that Lord Cowper,
although he loved the exercise of those public offices for
which he was so well fitted, knew how to retire into private
life with dignity and composure. One short anecdote, and
we have done. It so happened that Richard Cromwell, in
his old age, had to undergo an examination in Westminster
Hall, at a moment when the name of the ex-Protector’s family
was execrated through the kingdom. The Lord Chancellor
treated the fallen dignitary with more than common respect,
and courteously ordered a chair to be placed for him,—treatment
which contrasted with that experienced by Richard
when driven from the door of the House of Lords with insults
as one of the common mob, exclaiming as he went, ‘The last
time I was here I sat upon the throne!’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Cowper had gained the good fortune he deserved; he
built a house at Cole Green, and made a collection of pictures
which forms part of the splendid gallery now at Panshanger.
His London houses were situated in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and
Great George Street. He had also a lodging at Kensington,—‘the
roads about that distant spot being,’ we are assured,
‘so secure, that there was no danger in travelling thence to
London at night.’</p>

ELDEST son of the second Earl Cowper by
Lady Henrietta, youngest daughter and
co-heir of Henry d’Auverquerque, Earl of
Grantham. King George II., the Duke
of Grafton, and Princess Amelia stood
in person as sponsors at his baptism. In
1754 he came into a large fortune on the death of the aforesaid
Earl of Grantham, and in 1759 was elected M.P. for the
town of Hertford. While his father was yet alive, Lord
Fordwich (as he then was) went on his travels, and, arriving
at Florence, fell in love with that beautiful city, and with one
of its beautiful citizens, the Princess Corsi. The lady was
married, or the young lord would doubtless have carried her to
England as his wife, and thus escaped the blame, cast upon him
by Horace Walpole, of disobeying the summons of his dying
father in 1764. So delighted was George, Lord Cowper, with
his sojourn in Florence, which he had originally visited with
the intention of passing a short time there, that he remained
within its charmed walls for upwards of thirty years. He
outlived his infatuation for the fair Florentine, and married, in
1775, Anna, daughter of Charles Gore, a gentleman at that
time residing in Florence with his family, who was said to
have been the original of Goethe’s travelled Englishman in
<i>Wilhelm Meister</i>. Lord Cowper was most desirous of obtaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>permission to add the royal surname of Nassau to his own
patronymic, on the plea that he was one of the representatives
of the Earl of Grantham (an extinct title); but there were
many difficulties in the way, and while the matter was
pending he received a high mark of distinction from the
Emperor of Austria, through the instrumentality of his
Imperial Majesty’s brother, Peter Leopold, Grand Duke of
Tuscany, at whose Court Lord and Lady Cowper (but
especially the latter) stood in high favour. This was the
grant of a patent to Lord Cowper, which bestowed on him the
rank of a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire. That arch-gossip,
but most amusing letter-writer, Horace Walpole, in his
correspondence with his friend Sir Horace Mann, British
Envoy at Florence, takes a most unaccountable interest in the
private concerns and aspirations of Lord Cowper, and thus
animadverts on the subject of his foreign names and titles:
‘There is another hitch in the great Nassau question. The
objection is now started, that he must not bear that name
with the title of Prince. The Emperor thought he had hit on
a clever compromise for his <i>protégé</i>, by giving up the name
of Nassau, and substituting that of Auverquerque. But my
Lord’s cousins object to that also, so now he is reduced to
plain Prince Cowper, for which honour he has to pay £500.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Again: ‘I do not think either the Emperor or Lord Cowper
knows what he is about. Surely an English peer, with substantial
dignity in his own country, is more dignified than a
man residing in another country, and endowed with a nominal
principality in a third!’</p>

<p class='c035'>Again: ‘I believe both Emperor and Prince begin to regret
the step. The Imperial diploma dubs him Highness, but he
himself will not allow any one to address him in any other
way than Lord Cowper.’</p>

<p class='c035'>It was not very long after their marriage that Horace
Walpole glances at the report of a possible separation between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Lord and Lady Cowper, but without assigning any reason.
There can be little doubt that the union was not a happy one,
for, whatever other ground of complaint the husband might
have had, Lady Cowper was of a quarrelsome and unconciliatory
disposition, and her sister, who lived with the family at
Florence, seems, by all accounts, to have been far the more
amiable of the two. Miss Berry alludes to a visit she paid
her compatriots at Lord Cowper’s house in Florence, ‘where
you have the best of society, both native and foreign, and
where all the English (in particular) are desirous of obtaining
an introduction.’ She goes on to describe the house as ‘fitted
up in a peculiar manner: one room as a museum, another as a
laboratory, a third a workshop; in fact, too many to enumerate.’
He was evidently a man of very versatile tastes, and one who
had many irons in the fire at the same moment. In 1781
Horace Walpole, alluding to the fact that the three Cowper
boys had been sent over to England for their education, says,
‘It is astonishing that neither parent nor child can bring your
<i>principal</i> Earl from that specific spot,—but we are a lunatic
nation.’ Another letter speaks of a vacant green ribbon,
and the possibility it might be given to Lord Cowper, if he
were on the spot; ‘but he won’t come. I do allow him a
place in the Tribune at Florence. An English earl, who has
never seen his earldom, and takes root and has fruit at
Florence, and is proud of his pinchbeck principality in a third
country, is as great a curiosity as any in the Tuscan Collection.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Cowper did go to England at last, and Walpole owns
to his going to a concert at Mrs. Cosway’s—‘out of curiosity,
not to hear an Italian singer sing one song, at the extravagant
sum of £10—the same whom I have heard half a dozen
times at the opera-house for as many shillings—but to see an
English earl, who had passed thirty years at Florence, and
thought so much of his silly title, and his order from
Würtemberg! You know, he really imagined he was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>take precedence of all the English dukes, and now he has
tumbled down into a tinsel titularity. I only meant to amuse
my eyes, but Mr. Durens brought the personage up, and
presented us to each other. He answered very well, to my
idea, for I should have taken his Highness for a Doge of Genoa.
He has the awkward dignity of a temporary representative of
a nominal power. I wonder his Highness does not desire the
Pope to make one of his sons a bishop <i>in partibus infidelium</i>,
and that Miss Anne Pitt does not request his Holiness to
create her Principessa Fossani.’</p>

<p class='c035'>It is inconsistent with the character of Horace Walpole,
who did not disdain rank or titles, and who was by no means
insensible to the charm of decorations—whether of walls or
button-holes—to inveigh so harshly against a dignity which
entitles the owner to the privilege, dear in heraldic eyes, of
bearing his paternal coat on the breast of the Imperial Eagle.</p>

<p class='c035'>England could not long detain Lord Cowper from the
country of his adoption. He returned to Florence, where he
died in 1789. The greater part of the Italian pictures in this
beautiful collection was purchased by the third Lord Cowper,
who was a true lover of art, and who was reduced to great
difficulties, on more than one occasion, in conveying his
pictures out of Florence, the inhabitants of that city being
averse to parting with such treasures. One of the most valuable
is said to have been concealed in the lining of his travelling

concludes his notice of the first Earl Cowper with a
sincere tribute of admiration to Peter Leopold, the fifth earl:—</p>

<p class='c035'>‘He had too much delicacy of sentiment to take a leading
part in public life, but to the most exquisitely pleasing
manners he joined a manly understanding and a playful wit.

was poor and obscure; and his benevolent and exhilarating
smile is one of the most delightful images in my memory of
pleasures to return no more.’</p>

HE was surnamed the Junior, son of Count
John of Nassau Siegen by his wife, Margaret
de Waldeck. He began public life in
the service of the Archbishop of Cologne,
and afterwards entered that of the United
Provinces, in which he fought against Spain.
But the Count considered that he was slighted, and his
merits not duly appreciated by the Government, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>disgust he renounced the Protestant faith in 1609 (or 1613),
at the Hague, where he published an explanation of the
motives which led him to embrace the tenets of the Church
of Rome. He moreover transferred his military services to
the Emperor of Germany, Ferdinand <span class='fss'>II.</span>, the sworn enemy of
the Protestants, the adversary of the unfortunate King of
Bohemia, of Gustavus Adolphus, and all the heroes of the
Reformed religion in the early part of the Thirty Years’ War.
In 1620, when the Stadtholder, Frederic Henry, was besieging
Bois-le-Duc, the Count of Nassau Siegen (his kinsman)
invaded Holland at the head of eight or ten thousand men,
and took the town of Amersfoort. The following year, in
command of a small army, he encamped in the neighbourhood
of Rynberg, and did all in his power to prevent his brother
William from crossing the Rhine between Broek and Orsoy.
In this attempt he was defeated, wounded, and carried
prisoner to Wesel, where, we are told, his brother frequently
visited him during his captivity. When his wounds were
cured, Count John purchased his freedom with the sum of
ten thousand rixdollars; but he narrowly escaped being
taken prisoner a second time, in a naval engagement with the
Spaniards. This was at Mosselkreek (the Creek of Mussels),
where his vessels were stranded, and he lost a considerable
number of men. The Dutch on this occasion gave him the
derisive title of Mussulman. In 1637 he made an unsuccessful
attempt to surprise Rynberg; and in 1638 death
put an end to his adventurous, but by no means blameless,
career.</p>

<p class='c035'>It is impossible to look on Vandyck’s splendid picture
without experiencing a feeling of profound regret that a brave
and able soldier, a man of so imposing a presence, and so
noble a bearing, should have renounced the faith for which
numerous members of his family had fought and bled, and
drawn his sword against his native land in the service of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>alien sovereign. The proud order of the Golden Fleece
which hangs round his neck seems but a poor distinction
when we remember the circumstances by which it was
obtained. In 1618 he had married Ernestine, daughter of
Lamoral, Prince de Ligne, by whom he had one son and
three daughters:—</p>

<p class='c040'>John Francis Desideratus, Prince of Nassau Siegen,
Knight of the Golden Fleece, and Spanish Governor
of Guelderland in 1688. He had three wives: first,
Johanna Claudia, daughter of John, Count of
Köningseck, who died in 1664; second, Eleanor
Sophia, daughter of Hermann Fortunatus, Margrave
of Baden, who died in 1668; third, Isabella Clara
Eugenia de la Serre, <i>alias</i> de Montant, ‘a noble lady.’
She died in 1714. Prince John of Nassau Siegen had
eleven children. He died in 1690.</p>
<p class='c041'>The three daughters represented in this family group were—</p>
<p class='c040'>1. Ernestine, married to the Prince Maurice Henry, Hadawar.</p>
<p class='c040'>2. Clara Mary, married first Albert Henry, Prince de
Ligne, and afterwards Claudius Lamoral, his brother.</p>
<p class='c040'>3. Lamberta Alberta, who died unmarried.</p>

    <div>ADMIRAL DE RUYTER.</div>
    <div class='c000'><i>In armour, holding a truncheon. The other arm akimbo. Curtain.</i></div>
    <div class='c000'>BORN 1607, DIED 1676.</div>

BORN at Flushing, of which town his father
was a burgher. As a mere child Michael
de Ruyter was determined to be a sailor,
and gained the paternal consent that he
should go to sea as cabin-boy when only
eleven years of age. He rose quickly in
his profession, was made a pilot when still very young for
the post, and passed through the intermediate grades, till he
gained the command of a vessel. In 1635 he made several
campaigns in the East Indies, and in 1645 was sent as Vice-Admiral
in command of a Dutch fleet to assist the Portuguese
against the Spaniards. After two years’ retirement
from service, De Ruyter engaged the Algerine corsairs off
Sarley, and gained a complete victory. The Moors, who
were spectators of the conflict, insisted on his entering the
town in triumph, on a richly caparisoned horse, followed by
a long retinue, including many of the captive pirates.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>These ‘plagues of the ocean,’ as they were justly termed,
continued to give De Ruyter much annoyance, but he was
usually successful in his encounters with them, and in one
fierce combat he seized and hanged one of the most notoriously
cruel and rapacious of these ‘buccaneer sea-dogs.’ In
1659 he was sent, by order of the States-General, to the
assistance of Denmark against Sweden, an enterprise in
which he distinguished himself greatly, and gained the
gratitude of the King of Denmark, who complimented him
highly, and granted him a pension. On his return home De
Ruyter was received with great honour, and promoted. He
then proceeded to the coast of Africa, to look after some
Dutch colonies, of which England had taken possession.
England and the United Provinces were now in constant
collision, and the Dutch Admiral found a noble and well-matched
foe in the gallant commander Prince Rupert,
soldier, sailor, and artist. De Ruyter was afterwards joined
in command with Van Tromp, a worthy colleague, but of no
friendly spirit. During the time that negotiations were pending
for peace with England, at Breda, De Ruyter resolved,
so to speak, to hasten his opportunities; he therefore bore
down on Sheerness, burned all the available shipping, and,
continuing his work of destruction up the river Thames,
approached too near London to be agreeable to the more
peaceable portion of the citizens.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1671 he had sole command of his country’s fleet,
against the combined forces of England (under the Duke of
York) and France (under the Comte D’Estrées), and it is
but just to record that he was frequently successful, but
invariably brave. Indeed, the French Admiral wrote to
Colbert, the Minister, at home, ‘I would lay down my life
for the glory that De Ruyter has gained.’ In 1675 the
Spaniards had recourse to their old enemies, the Dutch,
to ask assistance for the inhabitants of Messina, against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the French, and De Ruyter was despatched to Sicily for
that purpose. A terrible sea-fight ensued, the French being
commanded by Duquesne, a brave and efficient officer;
many vessels were sunk and destroyed on both sides, and
the carnage was terrible.</p>

<p class='c035'>At the commencement of the action the gallant De Ruyter
had his left foot carried away, and a few moments afterwards
his right leg was shattered by a shell. Writhing with pain,
and covered with blood, the brave sailor remained on deck,
and issued his orders, even to the bitter end of the battle.
It was only when he became aware that five of his vessels,
including his own, were about to fall into the hands of the
enemy, that he could be prevailed upon to give the word for
retreat. Favoured by the approaching darkness, he made
the port of Syracuse, and in that town he died of his wounds.
His heart was carried to Amsterdam, where the States-General
caused a noble mausoleum to be erected to the memory
of this brave and patriotic commander. His name is still
venerated in his native country.</p>

<p class='c035'>The King of Spain sent De Ruyter the title of Duke, but
the patent did not arrive till after his death, and his children
wisely refrained from pressing any claim to rank, which
would have been incongruous in a Republic; and they
were more proud of their father’s simple name than of any
foreign and alien dignity. Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> expressed his regret for
the death of this brave commander in public, and when
reminded that he had lost a dangerous enemy, he replied
generously, ‘I always mourn the death of a great and brave
man.’ A medal was struck in honour of Admiral de Ruyter,
and the following distich was written on his name:—</p>

SON of Sir John Cooper of Rockbourne, county
Hants, by Anne, daughter and sole heir of
Sir Anthony Ashley, Bart., of Wimborne
St. Giles, county Dorset, where the future
Chancellor was born.</p>

<p class='c035'>In his Autobiography he describes his
mother of ‘low stature,’ as was also the aforesaid Sir Anthony,
‘a large mind, but his person of the lowest,’ while his own
father was ‘lovely and graceful in mind and person, neither
too high nor too low,’ therefore the pigmy body of which
Dryden speaks must have been inherited from the maternal
side.</p>

<p class='c035'>Sir Anthony was delighted with his grandson; and although
at the time of the infant’s birth the septuagenarian was on the
point of espousing a young wife, his affection was in nowise
diminished for his daughter, or her boy.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Cooper and her father died within six months of each
other. Sir John married again, a daughter of Sir Charles
Morrison, of Cassiobury, county Herts, by whom he had
several children. He died in 1631, leaving the little Anthony
bereft of both parents, with large but much-encumbered
estates, and lawsuits pending.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Many of his own relations being most inimical to his
interests, Anthony went with his brother and sister to reside
with Sir Daniel Norton, one of his trustees, who—we once
more quote the Autobiography—‘took me to London, thinking
my presence might work some compassion on those who
ought to have been my friends.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He refers to the suit in which they were now engaged.
The boy must have had a winning way with him (as the old
saying goes), for, when only thirteen, he went of his own accord
to Noy, the Solicitor-General, and entreated his assistance as
the friend of his grandfather. Noy was deeply touched, took
up the case warmly, and gained one suit in the Court of
Wards, stoutly refusing to take any fee whatever.</p>

<p class='c035'>After Sir Daniel Norton’s death, Anthony went to live with
an uncle, Mr. Tooker, near Salisbury, though it was supposed
Lady Norton would gladly have kept him under her roof,
with a view to a match with one of her daughters. He says
himself: ‘Had it not been for the state of my litigious fortune,
the young lady’s sweet disposition had made me look
no farther for a wife.’</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1637 he went to Exeter College, Oxford, where he
‘made such rapid strides in learning as to be accounted the
most prodigious youth in the whole University.’ By his own
showing, he was popular with his companions and well satisfied
with himself,—indeed, a general spirit of self-complacency pervades
these pages. In little more than a year he went to
Lincoln’s Inn, where he appears to have found the theatres,
fencing galleries, and the like, more to his taste than the
study of the law.</p>

<p class='c035'>An astrologer who was in old Sir Anthony’s house at the
time of the grandson’s birth cast the horoscope, and to the
fulfilment of these predictions may probably be attributed
young Anthony’s own predilection for the study of astrology
in later days. The horoscope in question foreboded feuds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>and trouble at an early age; and some years afterwards the
same magician, foreseeing through the medium of the planets
that a certain Miss Roberts (a neighbour without any apparent
prospect of wealth) would become a great heiress, he endeavoured
to persuade his pupil to marry her. The lady did
eventually come into a considerable fortune; but Mr. Tooker,
who was not over-credulous, had other views at the time for
his nephew; and accordingly, at eighteen, Ashley Cooper
became the husband of Margaret, the daughter of my Lord
Keeper Coventry, ‘a woman of excellent beauty and incomparable
gifts.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The young couple resided with the bride’s father in London,
Sir Anthony, as he now was, paying flying visits to Dorsetshire.
He was subject to fits, but even this infirmity redounded to
his advantage, according to his own version; how that being
in Gloucestershire on one occasion, and taken suddenly ill,
‘the women admired his courage and patience under suffering,’
and he contrived to ingratiate himself with the electors of
Tewkesbury to some purpose.</p>

<p class='c035'>He gives us an amusing and characteristic description of
how he won the favour of the electors and bailiffs of this town
by his conduct at a public dinner, where he and a certain Sir
Henry Spiller were guests, and sat opposite each other. The
knight, a crafty, perverse, rich man, a Privy Councillor, had
rendered himself very obnoxious in the hunting-field, and, at
the banquet aforementioned, began the dinner with all the
affronts and dislikes he could possibly put on the bailiffs and
their entertainment, which enraged and disgusted them, and
this rough raillery he continued. ‘At length I thought it my
duty to defend the cause of those whose bread I was eating,
which I did with so good success, sparing not the bitterest
retorts, that I had a complete victory. This gained the
townsmen’s hearts, and their wives’ to boot. I was made free
of the town, and at the next Parliament (though absent at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>time), was chosen burgess by an unanimous vote, and that
without a penny charge.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Sir Anthony had strange humours: he loved a frolic dearly.
He had a confidential servant who resembled him so much
that, when dressed in his master’s left-offs, the lackey was
often mistaken for his better. This worthy was a clever man-milliner,
and had many small accomplishments which made
him popular in country houses, and his master confesses that
he often listened to the valet’s gossip, and made use of it, in
the exercise of palmistry and fortune-telling, which produced
great jollity, and ‘of which I did not make so bad a use as
many would have done.’ With this account he finishes the
record of his youth. A time of business followed, ‘and the
rest of my life is not without great mixture of public concerns,
and intermingled with the history of the times.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Sir Anthony sat for Tewkesbury in 1639, but that Parliament
was hastily dissolved. He raised a regiment of horse
for the King’s service, and occupied places of trust in his own
county; but, believing himself unjustly treated and slighted
by the Court, he listened to the overtures of the Parliament,
and returned to Dorsetshire as colonel of a regiment in their
army.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1649 he lost the wife he dearly loved, to whose memory
he pays a most touching tribute in his Diary. But she left no
living child, and before the expiration of the year the widower
had espoused Lady Frances Cecil, daughter of the Earl of
Exeter, a Royalist.</p>

<p class='c035'>The friendship of the Protector and Sir Anthony was of a
most fitful and spasmodic nature,—now fast allies, now at
daggers drawn. Some writers affirm that, on the death of his
second wife, he asked the hand of one of Cromwell’s daughters;
others, that he advised the Protector to assume the Crown,
who offered it to him in turn!</p>

<p class='c035'>He held many appointments under the reigning Government,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>and continued to sit in Parliament; but having, with
many other Members, withstood the encroachments of the
great man, Oliver endeavoured to prevent his return, and,
not being able to do so, forbade him to enter the House of
Commons. (See the history of the times.) The Members,
with Ashley Cooper at their head, insisted on re-admittance.
Again ousted, again admitted; nothing but quarrels and
reconciliations. The fact was, that Sir Anthony was too
great a card to lose hold of entirely. He had still a commission
in the Parliamentary army, and a seat at the Privy
Council, circumstances that in nowise prevented him carrying
on a correspondence with the King ‘over the water.’ Indeed,
he was accused of levying men for the Royal service; arrested,
acquitted; sat again in Parliament under Richard Cromwell,
joined the Presbyterian party to bring back Charles, and when
the Parliament declared for the King, Sir Anthony was one of
the twelve Members sent over to Breda to invite his return.
While in Holland, Ashley Cooper had a fall from his carriage,
and a narrow escape of being killed. Clarendon (there was
no love lost between them) says it was hoped that by his
alliance (as his third wife) with a daughter of Lord Spencer
of Wormleighton, a niece of the Earl of Southampton, ‘his
slippery humour would be restrained by his uncle.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He now took a leading part in politics, was appointed
one of the Judges of the Regicides, created Baron Ashley at
the Coronation, and afterwards became Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Under-Treasurer, and further high offices, and in
1672 Lord Cooper of Pawlett, county Somerset, and Earl of
Shaftesbury; and so quickly did honours rain on him, that
the same year saw him Lord High Chancellor of England.
He appears to have given great umbrage to many of the law
officers by his haughty bearing. We are told ‘he was the
gloriousest man alive; he said he would teach the bar that
a man of sense was above all their forms; and that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>impatient to show them he was a superior judge to all who
had ever sat before on the marble chair.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He maddened the gentlemen of the long robe by his
vagaries and innovations, and defiance of precedents. He
wore an ash-coloured gown instead of the regulation black,
assigning as his reason that black was distinctive of the barrister-at-law,
and he had never been called to the bar.</p>

<p class='c035'>He went to keep Hilary term ‘on a horse richly caparisoned,
his grooms walking beside him,’ all his officers ordered
to ride on horseback, ‘as in the olden time.’</p>

<p class='c035'>No doubt the good Dorsetshire country gentleman, the
lover of sport and of horse-flesh, who had been accused of
regaling his four-footed favourites on wine and cheese-cakes,
had a mischievous pleasure in seeing the uneasy and scared
looks of his worshipful brethren, some of whom perhaps had
never sat on a saddle till that day.</p>

<p class='c035'>At all events, poor Judge Twisden was laid in the dust,
and he swore roundly no Lord Chancellor should ever reduce
him to such a plight again. Shaftesbury lived at this time
in great pomp at Exeter House, in the Strand, and was
in high favour with his Royal master, who visited him at
Wimborne St. Giles during the Plague, when the Court
was at Salisbury.</p>

<p class='c035'>At Oxford, when Parliament sat, he made acquaintance
with the celebrated John Locke, who afterwards became an
inmate of his patron’s house, his tried friend, and medical
adviser.</p>

<p class='c035'>The situations of public employment which Shaftesbury
obtained for this eminent man were, unfortunately, in the end,
the source of difficulty and distress rather than advantage.
The history of the Cabal, of which he was the mainspring, and
of which he formed the fourth letter (Clifford, Arlington,
Buckingham, Ashley, Lauderdale), would suffice for his
biography during the five years of its life. But it must never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>be forgotten that to Shaftesbury England owes the passing of
the Habeas Corpus Bill, as likewise one for making judges
independent of the Crown.</p>

<p class='c035'>The reader must seek elsewhere, and elect for himself,
whether Shaftesbury was or was not guilty of all the plots
and conspiracies against King and country of which he has
been accused. To the Duke of York he made himself most
obnoxious. He was instrumental in establishing the Test
Act, which made Roman Catholics ineligible for public offices;
he was, moreover, the champion of the Exclusion Bill, and
opposed James’s marriage with Mary of Modena; and there
is little doubt that the Duke did all to undermine Shaftesbury’s
favour with the King.</p>

<p class='c035'>There was always an element of humour mixed up with his
doings, even when fortune frowned on him. Finding that
the King meant to unseat him from the Woolsack, and that his
successor was already named, he sought the Royal presence.
The King was about to proceed to chapel. The fallen favourite
told Charles he knew what his Majesty’s intentions were, but
he trusted he was not to be dismissed with contempt. ‘Cod’s
fish, my lord,’ replied the easy-going monarch, ‘I will not do
it with any circumstances that may look like a slight,’ upon
which the ex-Minister asked permission to carry the Great
Seals of Office for the last time before the King into chapel,
and then to his own house till the evening.</p>

<p class='c035'>Granted permission, Shaftesbury, with a smiling countenance,
entered the sacred building, and spoiled the devotions
of all his enemies, during that service at least. Lord Keeper
Finch, who was to succeed him, was at his wit’s end, believing
Shaftesbury reinstated, and all (and there were many) who
wished his downfall were in despair.</p>

<p class='c035'>The whole account is most amusing and characteristic,
including the manner in which the Seals were actually resigned,
but we have not space to say more. Shaftesbury was indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>now ‘out of suits with fortune.’ In 1677 he, with other
noblemen, was committed to the Tower for contempt of the
authority of Parliament, and although other prisoners were
soon liberated, he was kept in confinement thirteen months.
On regaining his freedom he was made Lord President of the
Council, but, opposing the Duke of York’s succession, was
dismissed from that post in a few months. In 1681 he was
again apprehended, on false testimony, and once more sent to
the Tower on charge of treason, and that without a trial.</p>

<p class='c035'>His papers were searched, but nothing could be found
against him except one document, ‘neither writ nor signed
by his hand.’ The jurors brought in the bill ‘Ignoramus,’
which pleased the Protestant portion of the community, who
believed the Earl suffered in the cause of religion.</p>

<p class='c035'>Bonfires were kindled in his honour; one of the witnesses
against him narrowly escaped from the fury of the mob; a
medal was struck to commemorate his enlargement. Hence
the poem of that name from the pen of Dryden, suggested
by the King. On regaining his liberty, Shaftesbury went to
reside at his house in Aldersgate Street, when, finding his
enemies were still working against him, he took the friendly
advice of Lord Mordaunt, and after lying <i>perdu</i> in another
part of London for a night or two, he set off for Harwich, <i>en
route</i> for Holland, with a young relative, both disguised as
Presbyterian ministers, with long black perukes. Adverse
winds detained them at a small inn, when one day the landlady
entered the elder gentleman’s room, and, carefully shutting
the door, told him that the chambermaid had just been into
his companion’s apartment, and instead of a swarthy, sour-faced
dominie, had found a beautiful fair-haired youth. ‘Be
assured, sir,’ said the good woman, ‘that I will neither ask
questions, nor tell tales, but I cannot answer for a young girl’s
discretion.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The man who had been so hunted of late was touched,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>thanked the good soul, and bade his handsome young friend
make love to the maid, till the wind changed.</p>

<p class='c035'>The fugitives, however, had an extra run for it, as it was,
for the hounds were on their track. Fortunately the capture
of one of Shaftesbury’s servants, dressed like his master, gave
them time to embark.</p>

<p class='c035'>They arrived at Amsterdam after a stormy passage, where
Shaftesbury hired a large house, with the intention of remaining
some time, and all the more that he found himself treated
with great respect by all the principal inhabitants. But misfortune
pursued him. He was seized with gout in the stomach,
and expired on the 1st of January 1683. His body was
conveyed to England, and landed at Poole, whither the
gentlemen of his native county flocked, uninvited, to pay a
tribute to his memory, by attending the remains to Wimborne
St. Giles.</p>

<p class='c035'>We leave the sentence to be pronounced on the first Earl
of Shaftesbury to wiser heads than ours, but one remark we
feel authorised to make,—that we are not called on to believe
him as black as Dryden has painted him, since we cannot but
question the justice of the pen that described Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>
as the God-like David, in the far-famed poem of ‘Absalom
(the Duke of Monmouth) and Achitophel’ (Shaftesbury), which
loads the latter with invective:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A name to all succeeding ages curst,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For close designs and crooked counsels fit,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sagacious, bold, and turbulent of wit,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Restless, unfixed in principles and place,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In power unpleased, impatient of disgrace;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A fiery soul, which working out its way,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Fretted the pigmy body to decay....</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Great wits are sure to madness close allied;...</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Oh! had he been content to serve the Crown</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With virtues only proper to the gown,’ etc. etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>There spoke the Laureate, and woe indeed to the man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>who had such a poet as Dryden for his censor! Yet for all
this abuse, which he had written to order, Dryden could not
help bearing testimony as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Yet fame deserved no enemy can grudge,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The Statesman we abhor, but praise the Judge;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In Israel’s courts ne’er sate an Abbethdin</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With more discerning eyes or hands more clean,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Unbribed, unsought, the wretched to redress,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Swift of despatch, and easy of access.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>Lord Shaftesbury was kind and charitable to the poor
in his neighbourhood, and was very hospitable. In 1669
Cosimo de’ Medici, being in England, went to St. Giles’s,
and was so much pleased with his reception, that he kept up a
correspondence with his English friend, and sent him annually
a present of Tuscan wine. It has been adduced by some, in
evidence of his immorality, that on one occasion, while still
in favour with Charles, the King said to him, ‘I believe,
Shaftesbury, you are the greatest profligate in England.’ The
Earl bowed low, and replied, ‘For a subject, sire, I believe
I am.’ It would be hard to condemn a man on the testimony
of a repartee.</p>

THE fine old cathedral city of Worcester is
so justly proud of its noble citizen, the first
Lord Som&#x305;ers, that different districts have
contested the honour of his birthplace; but
the best evidence goes to prove that he was
born at his father’s estate of Whiteladies,
which at that period was not included in the precincts of the city.</p>

<p class='c035'>The house was a dissolved Carthusian nunnery, and had
been granted to the Som&#x305;ers family at the time of the Reformation.</p>

<p class='c035'>For two generations before the birth of Lord Som&#x305;ers, the
name was spelled without the final <i>s</i>, which probably gave rise
to the supposition that it had a common origin with that of
Van Somer, the famous Flemish painter. On the other hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>some writers contend that the name was derived from a St.
Omer, as in the case of St. Maur, St. Leger, and the like.</p>

<p class='c035'>Be this as it may, they undoubtedly claimed kinship with
the gallant admiral, Sir George Somers, who rediscovered the
island (or rather the cluster of islands) of Bermuda, so called
after one Juan Bermudez, ‘who was driven thereon by force
of tempest.’ The place did not enjoy a good reputation; it
was termed ‘the island of divelles,’ or the ‘enchanted isle,’
and was supposed to harbour sea-monsters, mermen, and ‘such
cattle,’ from which legend doubtless sprang Setebos and
Caliban. Admiral Somers was also wrecked here, and thus
rediscovered the whereabouts which had been lost; and he
was most desirous it should bear his name, and so it is still
called Bermuda or Somers’ (erroneously Summer’s) island.</p>

<p class='c035'>Purchas, in his <i>Pilgrimage</i>, gives a long description of the
abundance of sea-fowl, on which the shipwrecked mariners
feasted, and of the wonderful tameness of the birds,—for
Somers might have said with Alexander Selkirk:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c046'>
    <div>‘They are so unaccustomed to man,</div>
    <div>Their tameness is shocking to me.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>Purchas goes on to say, ‘Notwithstanding the wonted danger,
you may now touch at Bermuda, for danger hath made it not
so dangerous:’ after the fashion of many another peril that
calls for precautionary measures.</p>

<p class='c035'>Waller, in his didactic poem on the beauties of this region,
forgets to do honour to the gallant old ‘salt,’ who was as well
known for his daring rejoinder to King James <span class='fss'>I.</span> as for
his nautical adventures; it was when subjected to one of
the tyrant’s manifold acts of injustice. ‘I hope I may be the
last of sacrifices in your time. When from private appetite it
is resolved that a creature shall be sacrificed, it is easy to pick
up sticks enough from any thicket, whither it has strayed, to
make a fire to offer it with.’</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>The immediate ancestors of the Lord Chancellor had been
settled for some time on a small estate in Gloucestershire, called
Stoke Severne, and they also owned the ‘Whiteladies,’ then
a suburb of Worcester. Here, in 1585, the family entertained
Queen Elizabeth, in her progress through Worcestershire, and
although the Som&#x305;erses afterwards imbibed republican principles,
the bed in which good Queen Bess lay, and the cup
out of which she drank, were long preserved as precious
relics in the family.</p>

<p class='c035'>Queen Elizabeth was much pleased with her reception at
the Whiteladies, and indeed at Worcester altogether. More
especially was her Grace’s fancy taken by a conceit of Master
Som&#x305;ers, who caused a splendid pear-tree, loaded with fruit, to
be transplanted from his own garden to the market-place in
the town, as a decoration, at the time of the Queen’s public
reception,—in remembrance of which Elizabeth granted an
augmentation to the arms of the city, in the shape of three
pears, as may be seen to this day.</p>

<p class='c035'>Master Som&#x305;ers, the father of the future Peer, had been bred
up to the law, and practised as an attorney, but, when the
civil war broke out, in opposition to the majority of his fellow-citizens,
he took part with the Roundheads, and raised a troop
of horse to serve under Cromwell. He was for some time
quartered at Upton, near his own estate of Stoke Severne, the
parish church of which he frequented.</p>

<p class='c035'>Now the Rector was a Royalist, and a firm upholder of
Divine right, and he was very apt to mix political with theological
arguments in his sermons. Captain Som&#x305;ers had constantly
warned him against so doing, but in vain; and one Sunday the
good parson indulged in so much abuse of the Cromwell men
as to raise the ire of the Parliamentarian officer, who, drawing
forth a loaded pistol, lodged a shot in the sounding-board
above his reverence’s head.</p>

<p class='c035'>In spite of all this, King Charles passed the night previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>to the battle of Worcester, and that following, at the Whiteladies,
where, after ‘shifting himself’ into a disguise, he
left his trunk hose, his garters, and two pairs of fringed gloves,
to be added to the Royal Elizabethan relics. Lord Campbell
remarks that a species of sanctity had been attached to the
Whiteladies by both parties, since the building was spared,
when almost every other edifice was destroyed; but Nash,
the county historian, accounts for the circumstance by
saying that the soldiers spared the house on account of
its being a strong building, capable of holding 500 men with
safety.</p>

<p class='c035'>Not many days after the King’s flight, Captain Som&#x305;ers
brought his wife, Mistress Catherine (whose maiden name was
Ceaverne, a native of Shropshire), to this stronghold, she being
at the time in an interesting condition for the second time,
having already presented her husband with a daughter; and
there, to the best of our belief, was born, a few months afterwards,
the future Lord Chancellor of England, and the first
Peer of the name. Few good stories are told of his boyhood,
excepting one which was probably very much prized in the
home archives, and is remembered till this day, as an omen of
his future greatness. He was on a visit to his aunt, Mistress
Bluron, the wife of a Presbyterian minister, with whom he was
walking hand-in-hand amid the glories of her poultry-yard,
when a beautiful roost-cock lighted on the little fellow’s curly
head, and crowed three distinct times while perched thereon.
No less honour than the Woolsack could surely be prognosticated
by so splendid an augury! When, in modern times,
could there have been such literal <i>avium garritus</i>?</p>

<p class='c035'>The boy went to the College School at Worcester, where he
became the favourite model pupil of the master, Dr. Bright, a
distinguished classical scholar. He is described as weakly in
health, wearing a little black cap, but the ‘brightest boy in the
whole school, so studious and contemplative that he did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>care for the sports of his companions, and was usually seen
musing alone with a book in his hand during the hours of recreation.’
He appears to have gone to more than one other school,
and at intervals to have learned the business of an attorney in
his father’s office, the elder Som&#x305;ers having by this time resumed
the profession to which he was bred before he joined Cromwell’s
army.</p>

<p class='c035'>At the time of the Restoration he had solicited, and obtained,
a pardon, under the Great Seal, for his former disaffection to
the Crown, but, ‘being a lawyer,’ says Lord Campbell, ‘he
perhaps remembered Sir Edward Coke’s wise observation,
that “good men will never refuse pardon from God or the
King, because every man doth often offend both.”’ In 1667
young Som&#x305;ers matriculated, and was entered at Trinity College,
Oxford, but apparently only remained there a short time, and
did not take his degree. While at the University he showed
more predilection for the study of the <i>belles lettres</i> than for
that of law, in spite of which his father insisted on his becoming
his clerk at Whiteladies. The picturesque old
place was now not only inhabited by Som&#x305;ers, the well-to-do
solicitor, and his wife and children, but it had been converted
into a species of colony, and was peopled by several families
connected, for the most part, with the owner, either by blood or
marriage. Some of the occupants were engaged in the cultivation
of the large farm adjoining, others in producing all
kinds and colours for dyeing materials, or manufacturing cloth,
which trade was at that time in a flourishing condition in Worcester;
and, above all, in making bricks and tiles for rebuilding
the ruined city and suburbs. The latter calling gave rise to
the epithet by which the scurrilous libellers of later days
thought (vainly) to lower the pride of the great Lord Som&#x305;ers, by
calling him the brickmaker’s son! When the multifarious
labours of the day were at an end, the various inhabitants,
occasionally augmented by outside guests, met, to the number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>of twenty or thirty, round the table, in the old refectory of the
nunnery, where the produce of the farm and gardens afforded
them a plentiful and inexpensive banquet. John Som&#x305;ers,
senior, had great influence in electioneering matters, and also
received and entertained at his house many persons of weight
and influence,—among others, Sir Francis Winnington, a rising
lawyer, and Member for the city, afterwards Solicitor-General.
The good knight was much impressed by young John’s talents,
and recommended that he should pursue the study of the law,
in which profession, he remarked, many Worcestershire men
had risen to eminence. It took some time to persuade the
father to send his son away from the establishment, which
was growing more lucrative every day, but at length he
yielded to the wish of Sir Francis, and entered his son as
student of the Middle Temple, 1669. The youth returned,
however, and read law at Whiteladies for a year before
settling in the Temple, and, both at Worcester and in London,
he benefited by the friendship and tuition of his good friend
Sir Francis. His circle of acquaintance in London was, at first,
limited almost exclusively to lawyers, and amongst his intimates
was Sir Joseph Jekyll, afterwards his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c035'>But the young Templar returned for his vacations to
Worcester (although the society did not much suit his taste)
until the year 1672, when he met a genial spirit at Whiteladies.
His father was agent for the estates of several noblemen,
and, among others, of the young Earl of Shrewsbury, son to
the unfortunate Peer who had been killed in a duel with the
Duke of Buckingham,—his shameless wife, at least so goes
the tradition, holding her lover’s horse while he murdered
her husband.</p>

<p class='c035'>Grafton, the estate of the Shrewsburys, was at that time out
of repair, and the young Earl gladly accepted an invitation to
Whiteladies, and no sooner did our Templar come down from
London for his usual visit, than the two youths formed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>friendship which proved lifelong. They became inseparable
companions, both in their studies and their recreations, and
the intimacy continued when they returned to London. Lord
Shrewsbury took a delight in introducing Som&#x305;ers to the most
distinguished men of his acquaintance, whether remarkable for
birth or learning. John Som&#x305;ers, becoming aware of his own
deficiency in education, resolved to return to the University,
where he made the Classics his more especial study, without
neglecting his legal pursuits, or giving up his visits to home.
It speaks well for the liberality both of father and son,
that John was able and willing to contribute five pounds (a
large sum for a student in those days) towards the reparation
of the chapel; and in after years and better circumstances
he gave a larger donation for the same purpose, as a proof of
his attachment to his old College. We are told rather a laughable
story, which shows in what high repute he was held by
his father, who, in his frequent visits to London, used to leave
his horse at the George Inn at Acton, and in conversing with
the landlord seldom omitted a panegyric on ‘young John,’—so
much so, that mine host’s curiosity was inflamed, and he
requested to be allowed some day to see this prodigy. Mr.
Som&#x305;ers, in consequence, asked his son one time to escort him
on his way as far as Acton, and on entering the inn, he took
the landlord aside, and whispered, ‘I have brought him,
Cobbett, but you must not talk to him as you do to me, for
he will not suffer such fellows as you in his company.’</p>

<p class='c035'>John Som&#x305;ers, junior, was called to the bar in 1666, but did
not practise much till five years afterwards; and it was on the
occasion of the famous trial of the seven Bishops that he first
made his mark. Macaulay, in his eloquent account of the
transaction, does honour to the rising barrister. He gives an
animated description of the progress of these stout-hearted
Prelates on their committal to the Tower, to await their trial,
of which we give a short extract: ‘The river was alive with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>wherries when they came forth under a guard to embark, and
the emotion of the people broke through all restraint. Thousands
fell on their knees and prayed for the men who had
emulated the Christian courage of Ridley and Latimer; many
dashed into the water up to their waists, and cried on the holy
fathers to bless them. All down the stream, from Whitehall
to London Bridge, the royal barge passed between lines of
boats, whence arose a shout of “God bless your Lordships!”’</p>

<p class='c035'>John Som&#x305;ers had been chosen as junior counsel for the
Bishops on the trial. He had not yet had much opportunity of
distinguishing himself in public, ‘but his genius, industry, his
great and various accomplishments, were well known to a small
circle of friends, and in spite of his Whig opinions, his pertinent
and lucid mode of arguing, and the constant propriety of his
demeanour, had already secured to him the ear of the Court of
King’s Bench, and it was said of him beforehand that no man
in Westminster Hall was so well qualified to treat an historical
and constitutional question.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Even while endeavouring to keep within our prescribed
limits, we feel it is but simple justice to the future Chancellor
to quote the great historian’s own words: ‘Som&#x305;ers rose last.
He spoke little more than five minutes, but every word was
full of weighty matter, and when he sat down his reputation
as an orator and a constitutional lawyer was established. The
jury were long in coming to a decision, but when they did
return, and the foreman pronounced the verdict—“Not guilty”—amid
deathless silence, a tempest of rejoicing arose. Lord
Halifax threw up his hat, and ten thousand people who crowded
the Hall made the oaken roof crack with shouts, which, echoed
by the throng outside, resounded as far as Temple Bar, and
were caught up and sent back by all the boatmen on the
river. The acquittal was mainly attributed to Som&#x305;ers’s speech,
the effect of which upon the jury was greatly heightened by
the modesty and grace with which it was delivered. He now,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and ever, merited the praise that his pleading at the bar was
masculine and persuasive, free from everything that was trivial
and affected.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Amid the solemn details of this most important trial, the
comic element cropped up in a speech of one of the jurymen,
a Nonconformist, who was brewer to the Court. The story
goes that he complained bitterly of the dilemma in which he
was placed. ‘What am I to do?’ he asked piteously; ‘if I say
Not guilty, I shall brew no more for the Court; if I say Guilty,
I shall brew no more for anybody else.’ On the same day
that the Bishops were acquitted, a paper was drawn up,
entitled ‘The Association,’ censuring the Government of King
James <span class='fss'>II.</span>, and calling on William, Prince of Orange, to come
over to England, and deliver the country from Popery and
despotism. The name of Som&#x305;ers did not appear, but by
many it was believed that the wording of the document
emanated from him. It was signed by all his political friends,
and Lord Shrewsbury immediately afterwards went to the
Hague, laden with large supplies of money, to urge on the
Prince the advisability of his coming over without delay.
William answered by a ‘Declaration,’ announcing his readiness
(as the husband of the Princess Mary) to accede to the wishes
of the nation, and promised to proceed to England, ‘in order
to have a free and lawful Parliament assembled for the maintenance
of liberty and the Protestant religion, and by the decision
of that Parliament he would abide.’</p>

<p class='c035'>This document also was ascribed to Som&#x305;ers, or at all
events it was said to have been supervised by him, for he had
by this time, to quote the words of Lord Sunderland, become
the ‘very soul and spirit of his party.’ No sooner had King
James left the country than Som&#x305;ers was returned for his
native city, having refused to sit in the former Parliaments
under the two last Kings.</p>

<p class='c035'>This was in the so-called ‘Convention Parliament;’ and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>give Macaulay’s notice of the new Member’s first appearance
in the House of Commons. After enumerating the names of
many political veterans, he says: ‘But they were speedily
thrown into shade by two young Whigs, who, on this
great day, took their seats for the first time, and soon rose to
the highest honours of the State, who weathered the fiercest
storms of faction together, and, having been long and widely
renowned as statesmen, as orators, and as munificent patrons
of genius and learning, died within a few months of each other.
These were Charles Montagu and John Som&#x305;ers.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The latter led the debate in the Lower House, and in his
maiden speech, which was considered a model of eloquence,
he maintained that James, by his flight and abdication, had
forfeited all claim to allegiance, and he drew up a manifesto
to that effect, declaring the throne of England to be vacant.</p>

<p class='c035'>He was thus most instrumental in the passing of the Exclusion
Bill, which precluded the succession of a Popish Prince
to the Crown of England. In all the differences of opinion
which now ensued between the two Houses, John Som&#x305;ers
zealously supported the claims of William and Mary. He also
gained lasting renown by the declaration that he drew up
for classing under general heads ‘such things as were necessary
for the better security of our religion, laws, and liberties.’
Hence sprang the world-famed Bill of Rights, with which the
name of John Som&#x305;ers is indissolubly connected. William and
Mary were proclaimed King and Queen; Lord Shrewsbury
made his friend, and that friend’s merits, known to the new
Sovereigns; and Sir John Som&#x305;ers, Knight, was appointed
Solicitor-General. He now took a prominent part in every
public question of importance, evincing the utmost consistency
in his opinions and principles; and his biographer and earnest
admirer, Lord Campbell, appears never to have found fault
with his administration of justice, excepting in one instance,
namely, the course he pursued with regard to a Bill for regulating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>high treason—a question we leave to judicial minds.
But the same pen awards him great praise for the manner in
which he conducted prosecutions before Courts of Justice,
which he designates as ‘mild, candid, and merciful.’ Speaking
of the trial of Lord Preston and others for high treason (the
first State trial of the reign), in which his moderation and
humanity were universally extolled, Som&#x305;ers himself said: ‘I
did never think that it was the part of any, who were counsel
for the King in cases of this nature, to aggravate the crime of
the prisoners, or to put false colours on the evidence.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Indeed, the manner in which these trials were conducted
formed an epoch in legal annals, contrasting brilliantly with
the injustice and cruelty which had characterised former tribunals.
Lord Preston, though found guilty, and sentenced to
death, owed his respite and subsequent pardon to the recommendation
of Sir John Som&#x305;ers.</p>

<p class='c035'>When war was declared with France, it was the Solicitor-General
who drew up the declaration; and in 1692 he was
promoted to the office of Attorney-General, and shortly afterwards
chosen counsel for the plaintiff in the first trial for
criminal conversation, <i>i.e.</i> the Duke of Norfolk <i>versus</i> Sir John
Germaine. But the divorce was not granted till after Som&#x305;ers
became Chancellor. In 1693 he was again returned for
Worcester, and a few days afterwards the Great Seal of England
was intrusted to his keeping, and he took his seat at the
Council Board. Evelyn thus records the event: ‘The
Attorney-General Som&#x305;ers made Lord Keeper, a young lawyer
of extraordinary merit.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The appointment (with the exception, naturally, of adverse
politicians) was generally popular. Burnet says: ‘Som&#x305;ers is
very learned in his own profession, with a great deal
more learning in other professions,—divinity, philosophy, and
history.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He had great capacity for business, a fair and gentle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>temper, having all the patience and softness, as well as the justice
and equity, becoming a great magistrate. He had always
agreed in his notions with the Whigs, and had striven to bring
them to better thoughts of the King, and greater confidence
in him. During the seven years he presided in the Court of
Chancery he won golden opinions, having most important
judicial duties to perform, and acting on several occasions as
Lord Steward in State trials. A close friendship now existed
between the King and Som&#x305;ers, but the latter knew how to
uphold both his personal and official dignity, which he proved
in a most remarkable manner at the beginning of this reign,
in a passage of arms that occurred between his Royal master
and himself. During the time that the Seal was in commission,
his Majesty had exercised unlimited judicial patronage, and
conceived the idea of continuing to do so, unquestioned. He
was on the eve of embarking for Flanders at the time of
Som&#x305;ers’s appointment, and he sent Lord Nottingham to the
new Minister, with orders to make out patents for the Chief
Baron of the Exchequer, the Chief-Justice of Chester, and for
the Attorney-General. This cavalier manner of proceeding
did not suit Sir John Som&#x305;ers, and as the King was still detained
at Harwich, waiting for favourable winds, he wrote a respectful
but resolute letter to his Majesty on the subject, pointing
out, in clear, distinct terms, that, under the conditions imposed
on him, he must tender his resignation—<i>Anglicè</i>, he would
not accept a post shorn of all judicial patronage. The King
responded nobly to this straightforward appeal, declined the
resignation, paid the Lord Keeper the highest tribute as to
ability and fitness for the great office, announced his intention
of non-interference for the future, but ended by the hope that
Som&#x305;ers would take the names of the candidates already mentioned
into consideration.</p>

<p class='c035'>In fact, this short misunderstanding increased and cemented
the cordiality between King and Minister. The three men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>William had named were continued, but the office of
Attorney-General soon after falling vacant, was filled up by a
nominee of Som&#x305;ers’s own selection. Although he declined
the offer of a Peerage, he sat in the House of Lords as Speaker,
and exercised a weighty influence over William’s opinions.
On the subject of ‘unlicensed printing,’ the liberal King and the
liberal Minister were agreed, and the Bill was passed by which,
says Macaulay, ‘English literature was emancipated for ever.’</p>

<p class='c035'>It was strange how little excitement was caused by so great
an event. Neither Evelyn nor Luttrell allude to it in their
Diaries, and the Dutch Minister forgot to mention it in his
despatches.</p>

<p class='c035'>However, from this time forth, the liberty of the Press was
assured; and ‘now we have only to be watchful,’ Lord
Campbell sapiently remarks, ‘lest the Press itself be not turned
into an engine of tyranny.’</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1690 Queen Mary was attacked with small-pox, and to
the inexpressible grief of her husband, shared by the greater
part of the nation, she died after a very short illness. Friendly
messages had been exchanged between her and her sister, but
Mary’s state was too critical to allow of her being exposed to
the excitement of an interview. When the last scene was
over, and the last duties paid to the beloved Queen and consort,
the attempt at reconciling the Princess of Denmark and
her brother-in-law was renewed, and Lord Sunderland, the
Duke of Marlborough, and Sir John Som&#x305;ers, joined to promote
the wished-for result. Anne had been persuaded to
write to the King, who, stunned by grief, showed little inclination
to respond to her advances. Som&#x305;ers therefore, bent on
carrying out his object, made his way into the Royal presence
at Kensington, where he found William absorbed in speechless
grief. He waited for some time in respectful sympathy,
hoping that the King would break the painful silence, but was
at length compelled to take the initiative.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>With the gentle delicacy that characterised him, the Lord
Keeper broached the subject, pointing out how essential it
was, on public as well as private grounds, that the enmity
between his Majesty and his wife’s sister should cease. ‘Do
as you will,’ replied the unhappy widower, ‘I can think of no
business.’ An interview was accordingly arranged. Anne
was graciously received, apartments assigned her in St. James’s
Palace, and due honour paid her as heir-presumptive to
the Crown. William once more pressed a Peerage on Sir
John (through his friend, now Duke of Shrewsbury), but it
was again declined. He was placed virtually at the head of
the Regency (the Archbishop of Canterbury presiding only
in name), when the King again left England for a foreign
campaign.</p>

<p class='c035'>He took a prominent part in the great measure for the
reformation of the coinage, and drew up and strongly advocated
a plan by which clipping money could be prevented; but
this was not carried into effect. Lord Macaulay praises him
highly for the appointments he made of such eminent men as
Sir Isaac Newton and John Locke, for the respective posts of
Warden of the Mint and a Lordship of Trade.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1697 Sir John resigned the Seals, only to have them
returned to him, with the title of Lord Chancellor and Baron
Som&#x305;ers of Evesham, county Worcester, as also grants of the
manors of Reigate and Howleigh in Surrey, with a yearly
income to enable him to keep up the same. On the retirement
of Lord Godolphin, the Ministry became wholly Whig,—Montagu,
Russell, Som&#x305;ers, and Wharton forming ‘the Junto.’
In the same year the Peace of Ryswick was signed, by which
France made great concessions, and acknowledged William as
King of England, and Anne as his successor, a circumstance
which gave rise to much rejoicing. But serious differences
took place between the King and his Parliament, which
required the disbanding of the troops that had done such good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>service in foreign campaigns. The most stormy discussions
ensued, and the press, in all the wild ardour of recent emancipation,
thundered with controversy. To Lord Som&#x305;ers was
attributed (indeed Macaulay speaks of the authorship as a certainty)
a treatise, called ‘The Balancing Letter,’ which made a
great noise at the time, weighing, as it did, the arguments for
and against the momentous question, but undoubtedly leaning
towards the advisability of maintaining a small standing army.
In spite of William’s vehement opposition, he found himself
compelled to ship off his beloved Dutch Guards, and to diminish
the English forces.</p>

<p class='c035'>Until this time the life of John Som&#x305;ers had been uninterrupted
in its prosperity and advancement; but a change in
his fortunes was now impending. Henceforward he had both
public and private trials to encounter, added to which, his
health had become much impaired. In July 1698, Parliament
being dissolved, and the King gone to Holland, Lord Som&#x305;ers
gladly availed himself of the opportunity to recruit his bodily
powers, by drinking the waters in the pleasant retirement of
Tunbridge Wells. The question of the Spanish succession
(Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>, king of that country, being at the time in
a dying state) belongs rather to the political history of
Europe than to the biography of an individual, yet Lord
Som&#x305;ers was so intimately connected with the so-called
‘Tradition Treaties,’ that we cannot altogether keep silence on
the matter. Before the King’s departure for Holland, William
had already consulted Som&#x305;ers on the subject, and, on arriving
at the Loo, he wrote, authorising him to consult with any of his
colleagues, on whose discretion and secrecy he could rely, and
asking for opinions on the arrangement proposed, which his
Majesty detailed at full length. Now such a treaty could not
be concluded without the appendage of the Great Seal and the
signature of one Secretary of State. The Lord Chancellor was
therefore directed to send full powers to the Loo, sealed, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>with blanks left for the names of the Plenipotentiaries; and it
was strongly urged that the clerks whose duty it was to draw
up the documents should be kept in profound ignorance of
the subject, and the importance of the work they were performing.
The Royal missive found ‘Som&#x305;ers at a distance
from his political friends, his delicate frame enfeebled by the
labours and vigils of many months, and his aching head
giddy with the first draughts of the chalybeate spring.’ But
he lost no time, and communicated promptly with all the
leading statesmen, who agreed with the King in wishing to
see the question of the Spanish succession settled without
delay. Som&#x305;ers, however, delicately hinted to his master
that he and his colleagues had misgivings on many points of
the treaty, although the Royal wishes had been complied
with.</p>

<p class='c035'>The powers were sent off, the enjoined secrecy observed,
the blanks left for the names of two Commissioners, who, the
Lord Chancellor suggested, should be English, either by birth
or naturalisation, and consequently responsible to Parliament.</p>

<p class='c035'>A second Partition Treaty was shortly afterwards drawn up
and signed, with fresh clauses and allotments to the different
European powers, with the same secrecy; and when the terms
of these treaties became known in England, a great outcry
was raised against the Whigs, and strenuous efforts made to
overthrow the Administration. The Lord Chancellor, in particular,
became the mark for attacks of different kinds, such as
his misconduct in the appointment and dismissal of magistrates,
while a novel charge for the dignitary of the Woolsack
was adduced against John Lord Som&#x305;ers, namely that of piracy
on the high seas,—not in person, indeed, but by proxy.
Thus it came about: he, in common with other Ministers, had
subscribed a sum of several hundreds towards the fitting out
of a ship called <i>The Adventure Galley</i>, for the purpose of
ridding the Indian seas of pirates. The command was given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>to Captain William Kid, a naval officer, who had hitherto
borne a high character for honour as well as courage.</p>

<p class='c035'>As may easily be believed, Lord Som&#x305;ers knew nothing of
the matter further than that he thought it became the post he
occupied to assist in such a public service; and a grant was
made to all the undertakers of the scheme that they should
become possessed of any booty taken from the pirates by
their ship. Captain Kid was armed with full powers to sink,
burn, and destroy the pirates, but on breathing the air of the
buccaneering seas, he turned pirate himself, and became a
dangerous foe to honest traders of all nations, till, after a
sharp encounter with an English frigate, he was taken, and
brought home in irons. A motion was now brought forward
by his (Som&#x305;ers’s) political adversaries, that the Lord Chancellor
should be made responsible for all the outrages committed by
Kid, with whom, they affirmed, he had intended to go shares
for the purpose of swelling his own coffers,—‘Such black constructions,’
says Burnet, ‘are men apt to put on the actions of
those whom they intend to disgrace.’ The charge, being preposterous,
was rejected by a large majority.</p>

<p class='c035'>A Bill was now brought in to resume the Irish forfeited
estates, which the King had bestowed on his Dutch favourites,
and Lord Som&#x305;ers incurred both the Royal displeasure
and that of the Opposition in Parliament for his absence
during the debates, although he pleaded the excuse of bad
health. William expected assistance from the Chancellor in
opposing this measure, but the public opinion was so strong
that Som&#x305;ers did not consider it advisable to support his
Majesty. His enemies had now become persistent in their
attacks; and a motion was made in the House of Commons
to the effect that ‘the King should be advised to remove the
present Lord Chancellor from his councils for ever,’ in common
with other leading Ministers.</p>

<p class='c035'>He had been absent from his duties for some time, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>consequence of failing health, in spite of which the Opposition
did all in their power to induce him to coalesce in the formation
of a new Government; and in answering the overtures
made him by Lord Sunderland, Som&#x305;ers replied that he
considered such a step would be inconsistent with honour.</p>

<p class='c035'>The refusal naturally increased the bitterness of his adversaries,
and Harley especially, who rose in arms against
him.</p>

<p class='c035'>William, with all his predilection for the Chancellor, was
at length persuaded of the expediency of removing him, and
Lord Som&#x305;ers received a hint to that effect, ‘which determined
him to wait on his Majesty at Kensington, in order to know
his real mind.’ The King told him plainly that the time had
come when it was necessary for the Seals to pass into other
hands, at the same time expressing a wish that Som&#x305;ers himself
would resign.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Chancellor begged his Majesty’s pardon for following
the advice of numerous friends, who had warned him against
such a step, which would be ascribed to guilt or fear; adding
that he well knew the designs of his enemies; that the Great
Seal was his greatest crime, and if permitted to keep it, in spite
of their malice, he would do so, being well aware what a bad
use they would make of it. He had no fear of them, but he
would be firm to his friends, with more in that style; but the
King only shook his head, and said, ‘It must be so.’ And thus
was Lord Som&#x305;ers discharged from the great office which he
had held for so many years, ‘with the highest reputation for
capacity, integrity, and diligence.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Strangely enough, this ever-coveted post was offered to
and refused by several men ‘high in the law,’ possibly from
the fear of comparison with such an illustrious predecessor.
The Seals were at length delivered to Sir Nathan Wright, ‘in
whom,’ says Burnet, ‘there was nothing equal to the post,
much less to the man who had lately filled it.’</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Wright represented a dark shadow between two such
shining lights as Som&#x305;ers and Cowper.</p>

<p class='c035'>After a short residence at Tunbridge Wells for the benefit
of the waters, the ex-Chancellor retired to his villa, and,
resuming his literary pursuits, strove to forget all the mortification
and humiliation to which he had lately been exposed.
Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span>, breaking through the conditions imposed by
the Tradition Treaty, took advantage of a will made by
the Spanish king on his deathbed, in which the imbecile
Charles had been made to bequeath his dominions to the
French king’s grandson, Philip of Anjou; and the young
prince was despatched to Madrid with a splendid and exulting
Court. A violent outcry ensued in England against the Whigs,
and Lord Som&#x305;ers in particular, to whom this public catastrophe
was in a great measure attributed. Parliament was
dissolved, and on the reassembling of the new House, the
Commons proposed to impeach the ex-Chancellor for the
part he had taken in concluding these treaties, and for other
high crimes and misdemeanours. Prior thus alludes to the
circumstance in writing to the Duke of Manchester: ‘I
congratulate you on being out of this noise and tumult, where
we are tearing and destroying every man his neighbour.
To-morrow is the great day, when we expect my Lord
Chancellor to be fallen upon, though God knows of what
crime he is guilty, but that of being a great man and an upright
judge.’ Som&#x305;ers begged to be heard in his own defence,
and his demeanour was so dignified, and his explanation so
clear, as to enlist many members on his side, notably Robert
Walpole, a young senator, afterwards Prime Minister, who took
the warmest interest in Lord Som&#x305;ers’s cause, and voted in
his behalf. Notwithstanding, the motion for the impeachment
(with that of four other noblemen) was carried in the House of
Commons—a measure which caused tremendous indignation
in the Upper House, ‘at the infringement of their privileges;’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>while the King’s reply to the Lower House conveyed a rebuke
(though couched in mild terms) for the irregularity of their
proceedings. In spite of King and Peers the impeachment
commenced, and fourteen articles were exhibited against
Lord Som&#x305;ers. The six first concerned his share in carrying out
the Partition Treaties; the next five accused him of passing
illegal grants of Crown property in his own favour; the
thirteenth, of giving a commission to William Kid, pirate;
‘while the last,’ says Lord Campbell, ‘was a frivolous charge
of judicial delinquency.’</p>

<p class='c035'>A violent altercation now took place between the two
Houses of Parliament regarding the time and manner of the
trial, the Whig element at that time being paramount among
the Lords, while the Tories preponderated in the Commons.
So it came to pass, when the Peers were seated in great state
in Westminster Hall, and Lord Som&#x305;ers placed within the bar,
the Commons were summoned to make good their indictment,
but in vain. A long pause ensued, but not one member appeared,
and after another solemn procession to and from their
own House, their Lordships decided the question by themselves.</p>

<p class='c035'>John Lord Som&#x305;ers was acquitted by a majority of his
peers, and the impeachment dismissed. ‘The following comparison
between his demeanour and that of a former Chancellor,
Lord Verulam, on a similar occasion, is thus drawn
by Joseph Addison: ‘The conduct of these extraordinary
persons under the same circumstances was vastly different.
One, as he had given just occasion for his impeachment, sank
under it, and was reduced to such abject submission as
diminished the lustre of so exalted a character. But Lord
Som&#x305;ers was too well fortified in his integrity to fear the
impotence of an attack on his reputation, and though his
accusers would gladly have dropped their impeachment, he was
instant for the prosecution, and would not let the matter rest
till it was brought to an issue.’</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>The two Houses fell to fighting once more, and fierce and
bitter hatred was fostered by the late proceedings. The Duke
of Shrewsbury, Som&#x305;ers’s early and faithful friend, alluding to
these squabbles, thus writes to him from Rome: ‘I cannot
help referring to my old opinion, and wonder that a man can
be found in England, who has bread, that will be concerned
in public business. Had I a son I would sooner breed him
a cobbler than a courtier, and a hangman than a statesman.’</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1701 James <span class='fss'>II.</span> died, and Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> astonished
Europe in general, and England in particular, by recognising
the Pretender as King of England,—a step which even
incensed the Jacobites, jealous of foreign interference, and
set the Whig party in a flame. A reaction now took place in
favour of the latter faction: the King dismissed his Tory
Ministers, and it was confidently believed that in the formation
of a new Cabinet Lord Som&#x305;ers would resume office. But
William’s days were numbered. His health had long been a
source of anxiety to his friends and the nation at large, when
a fatal accident hurried the crisis. He had not yet relinquished
his favourite exercise of riding, and even occasionally hunted,
but neither his seat nor his hand was what it had been.
Riding one day through his favourite haunt of the Home Park
at Hampton Court, mounted on ‘Grey Sorrel,’ the horse,
having just broken into a gentle canter, stumbled at a molehill,
and fell on his knees, throwing his rider, who broke his collar-bone,
and otherwise injured himself. The bone was set;
William proceeded in his coach to Kensington, but he never
rallied. ‘His last days,’ says his enthusiastic admirer Macaulay,
‘were worthy of his life.’ He transacted business calmly,
took an affectionate leave of his friends, joined in prayer with
the two Bishops who attended him, and breathed his last.
Round his neck was found, suspended to a black riband, the
locket which contained the hair of his beloved wife.</p>

<p class='c035'>In William <span class='fss'>III.</span> Lord Som&#x305;ers lost a sincere and admiring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>friend, and far different was the treatment he met with from
the new Sovereign. In a combined Ministry of Whigs and
Tories, not only had he no post assigned him, but he was not
allowed to renew the oaths of a Privy Councillor. His name
was struck out of the Commission of the Peace in every
county in England, and it was intimated to him that her
Majesty would not admit him to the Royal presence. Anne
condescended to the mean spite of suspending the pension
granted to Addison, whose only crime was that Lord Som&#x305;ers
esteemed and protected him. Such petty conduct on the part
of the Queen called forth no reprisals from the man who had
his country’s welfare at heart. Finding that Godolphin and
Marlborough considered it expedient to adopt the home and
foreign policy which he advocated, Som&#x305;ers gave his support
to the Government, and was a diligent attendant in the House
of Lords. Indeed, he now divided his time between his
Parliamentary duties and the enjoyment of literary and
scientific pursuits. President of the Royal Society, he continued
his friendship with Addison, and exerted himself
unwearyingly in his behalf. Although an ex-Minister, and
slighted by the Court, he still carried great weight in public
measures, especially in the famous case of the Aylesbury election
trial. This was an action brought against the returning
officer by a man who accused him of not recording his vote,
and the case coming by appeal before the Lords, the Commons
declared it a breach of privilege. The warfare between the
two Houses was now resumed, and waged for some time as
fiercely as that between France and England. In 1706 Lord
Som&#x305;ers was most instrumental in negotiating the Union with
Scotland, as, in the fluctuating state of parties, the constant
coalitions and mosaic Governments which were formed, his
great talents were generally recognised in an emergency. The
death of Prince George of Denmark in 1708 brought about
further changes, and the presidency of the Council becoming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>vacant, Lord Som&#x305;ers succeeded to the post. The appointment
gave general satisfaction, for, says Burnet, ‘it was expected
that propositions for a general peace would shortly be made,
and so they reckoned that the management of that upon which
not only the safety of the nation, but all Europe, depended,
would be in sure hands. Som&#x305;ers was a man of inflexible
integrity, on whom neither ill practices nor false colours were
like to make any impression.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He remained President of the Council until the famous trial
of Dr. Sacheverell. Impeached by the Whigs for preaching
against them and the Government, Sacheverell escaped with a
light sentence, but the proceedings were followed by the downfall
of the Administration, which was replaced by one composed
entirely of Tories,—Harley, St. John, etc.</p>

<p class='c035'>When the news of the Queen’s dangerous illness became
known, Som&#x305;ers put himself into communication with the
Elector of Hanover, but the curious scene which took place at
the last Privy Council held in this reign is given in our
notice of Lord Chancellor Cowper, between whom and Lord
Som&#x305;ers a warm friendship had long existed. On the morning
of Sunday, the 1st of August 1714, Queen Anne expired, and
a meeting of the Lords Justices was immediately held. Lord
Som&#x305;ers was not present, on account of his infirm health, but
he attended the Privy Council, and took the oaths of allegiance
to George <span class='fss'>I.</span> On the arrival of that monarch in England,
and the reinstatement of the Whigs in office, Som&#x305;ers would
inevitably have joined the Ministry in his former capacity of
Chancellor, but his increasing indisposition determined him to
decline any public post, even the comparatively light duties of
President of the Council having become irksome to him; but
he promised to attend the meetings of the Privy Council as
often as it was possible for him to do so, and he received an
additional pension as a mark of public gratitude. He made
a point of being present at the first council, which was held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>in George <span class='fss'>I.</span>’s reign, but his infirmities gained upon him,
and a paralytic affection incapacitated him from the exertion
consequent on public business. He became torpid and inactive
in mind and body; when a sudden fit of the gout roused
him for a time from his lethargy. This happened at the
moment that the Septennial Bill, a measure in which he had
always taken the deepest interest, was pending. His mind
brightened up, his intellect was re-sharpened, and he took to
conversing with his well-named physician, Dr. Friend, on
passing affairs, with all the clearness and vigour of former
times. The good doctor hurried off with the good news to
Lord Townshend, one of the chief promoters of the Bill,
who instantly flew to his ancient colleague to consult him on
the subject. On entering the room, the dying statesman
embraced his old friend, cordially congratulated him on the
work in which he was employed (having, he said, never approved
of the Triennial Bill), and ended by assuring him of
‘my hearty approbation in the business, for I believe it will
be the greatest support possible to the liberty of the country.’</p>

<p class='c035'>When the gout subsided, Lord Som&#x305;ers fell back into a
state of torpor and helplessness, from which he was released
by death on the 26th of April 1716, the very day the Bill
in question was passed. He died of apoplexy at his villa in
Hertfordshire, and was buried in the parish church of
North Mymms, where a plain monument bears this modest
inscription:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c046'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Right Honourable</span> JOHN LORD SOM&#x305;ERS,</div>
    <div><span class='sc'>Baron of Evesham</span>,</div>

    <div><span class='fss'>DAME ELIZABETH JEKYLL</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>The sister who loved and admired him so ardently felt
doubtless that eulogium would be misplaced, and that all who
read the name would recall the virtues, talents, and patriotism
of her noble-hearted brother. Lord John Russell does him
ample justice when he says, ‘Som&#x305;ers is a bright example of
a statesman who could live in times of revolution without
rancour, who could hold the highest posts in a Court without
meanness, who could unite mildness and charity to his
opponents with the firmest attachment to the great principles
of liberty, civil and religious, which he had early
espoused, long promoted, and never abandoned;’ while
Mackintosh says, ‘Som&#x305;ers seems to have nearly realised the
perfect model of a wise statesman in a free community.’
Notwithstanding the accumulation of professional and public
business which fell to his share, from the day he arrived
in London, he not only found time (as we have observed
before) for literary studies and compositions, but for indulging
in the society and correspondence of distinguished men of
letters—foreigners as well as English. He held the poet
Vincenzo Filicaja in high estimation, which was indeed reciprocal,
as a Latin ode written in honour of ‘My Lord Giovanni
Som&#x305;ers, Cancelliere di Gran Brettagna,’ testifies.</p>

<p class='c035'>Steele, Prior, and Congreve were among his associates.
Newton, Locke, Addison, and Swift were marked out by him
for preferment. He was a noble patron, and rewarded merit
wherever he found it, and had it in his power. Lord Som&#x305;ers
was an exemplary son, and his mother (who survived her
husband many years) had the satisfaction of seeing ‘little
Johnnie’ rise to the highest honours of the State. Addison
vouches for the religious faith of his benefactor, and tells us
how unremitting he was in the performance of his devotional
services, both in public and in his own family. Som&#x305;ers never
married, although in early life he wooed and won the affections
of one Mistress Rawdon, the daughter of a rich Alderman, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>broke off the match on the plea of the insufficiency of marriage
settlements. We feel an inward conviction that in later days
Sir John Rawdon must have repented his arbitrary decision.
The title became extinct at Lord Som&#x305;ers’s death, his property
being shared by his two sisters, of whom the elder married
Charles Cocks, Esquire of Castleditch, and the younger Sir
John Jekyll, Master of the Rolls, an early friend and fellow-lawyer
of her brother. From Mrs. Cocks descended the late
Earl Som&#x305;ers, to whom the present imperfect sketch of his
ancestor was submitted in manuscript, but who has not, alas!
lived to read it in the completed form.</p>

<p class='c035'>He was indeed a worthy descendant of a great man,
and by his death society at large, and a band of admiring
and loving friends, have sustained an irreparable loss; while
on the domestic hearth that light has been quenched
which shed so radiant a glow on all those who clustered
fondly round it. A scholar, an artist, a traveller, a linguist,
the versatility of his information could only be equalled by
the graceful refinement of his wit and the tenderness of his
sympathy. He was one of those rarely gifted men, on whom
the mantle of moral and intellectual qualities sit so easily,
that in his genial company no feeling of inferiority was imposed
on others. On the contrary—as the writer of these
lines can testify, from grateful experience,—those who had the
privilege of conversing with him partook for the moment, in
some slight degree, of the brightness and intelligence of his
rich nature.</p>

HE was the third son of Lewis de Nassau,
Lord of Leek, Odyke, Auverquerque, and
Beverwaart, by Elizabeth, daughter of the
Count de Horn. He formed part of
William of Orange’s suite when that Prince
came over to England in 1670, and on the
occasion of a visit to Oxford, De Nassau had the degree of
D.C.L. conferred upon him. In the campaigns which
ensued in Flanders, he was brother-in-arms to his cousin and
Royal master, and gained general approbation for his courage
and patriotism. When William <span class='fss'>III.</span> ascended the throne of
England, Auverquerque was appointed Master of the Horse,
and allowed to retain his post of Captain of the Dutch Guards
who had come over to this country. He was also naturalised
by Act of Parliament. Macaulay speaks of this ‘gallant soldier
as uniting the blood of Nassau with that of Horn. He wore
with just pride a costly sword, presented to him by the States-General,
for having, on the bloody day of St. Denis, saved
the life of William of Orange by interposing himself between
his Highness and a French soldier, whom he killed on the
spot.’ Auverquerque likewise received a brace of pistols,
richly mounted in gold, and a pair of horse-buckles of the
same precious metal.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>In 1690 he was with the army that embarked for Ireland,
headed by the King in person; fought with his Royal master
at the battle of the Boyne, and was afterwards sent to Dublin
(hastily evacuated by James <span class='fss'>II.</span> and his adherents) to take
possession of the city and keep the peace. He was also with
William at the unsuccessful siege of Limerick, and subsequently
served with great distinction in the campaigns in
Flanders against the French.</p>

<p class='c035'>But it was at the battle of Steinkirk, in 1692, that Auverquerque
immortalised himself by his gallantry. The French
army, commanded by the brave and eccentric Duke of Luxembourg,
was encamped at Steinkirk, six miles from the King
of England’s headquarters. Luxembourg was one of the most
extraordinary compounds of physical and moral incongruities.
Macaulay describes him as a valetudinarian and a voluptuary,
whose camp was of the most luxurious, who usually selected
his quarters with a view to his culinary department, and whose
thoughts were almost as much taken up with his <i>batterie de
cuisine</i> as with his batteries in the field,—a little ugly hump-backed
gnome, who was accredited with powers of witchcraft,
and had the spirit of a lion. On his camp William made a
night surprise, but Luxembourg was one of those spirits who,
in the literal meaning of the word, cannot be surprised. He
was the king of emergencies; ‘his mind’—we again borrow the
language of Macaulay—‘nay, even his sickly and distorted
body, seemed to derive health and vigour from disaster and
dismay.’</p>

<p class='c035'>In his army were the flower of the French chivalry. The
noble historian, whom we are never tired of quoting, describes
the appearance of the young Princes of the blood-royal of
France,—‘brave not only in valour, but in the splendour of
their brilliant uniforms, hastily donned and half fastened.’
They had orders to charge the English: ‘No firing was the
word; sword in hand, do it with cold steel.’</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>In the order of battle, the division which was to lead the
van was that of General Mackay (the brave soldier who had
done such good service in Scotland, Ireland, and elsewhere).
They first encountered the Swiss, and drove them back with
fearful slaughter, after so close a fight that the muzzles of the
muskets crossed.</p>

<p class='c035'>But the English were borne down, after a noble resistance,
by the French troopers. They never ceased to repeat that, if
Count Solmes, who commanded them, had done his duty,
they would have been successful; but he forbade his infantry
to stir; he would not send them, he said, to be slaughtered.
The Duke of Ormonde wished to advance to the assistance
of his countrymen, but was not permitted to do so.</p>

<p class='c035'>Mackay sent to say if he were not reinforced, his men
were doomed to destruction. It was of no avail; ‘God’s will
be done,’ said the brave veteran with his latest breath, and
‘he died as he had lived, a good Christian.’ Five regiments
were entirely cut to pieces. It was at this juncture that
Auverquerque came to the rescue with two fresh battalions,
and the splendid manner in which he brought off the remains
of Mackay’s division was long remembered and gratefully
acknowledged by the English. In the debates which ensued
in the House of Commons, when the events of the war by
land and sea were discussed, there was much difference of
opinion, and the question of the disadvantages of English
troops being commanded by aliens was mooted. The conduct
of Solmes was almost universally reprehended. Four or five of
the colonels, who had been present at Steinkirk, took part in
the debate, and, amid many warring opinions, full justice was
done to the valour and conduct of Auverquerque.</p>

<p class='c035'>On the other hand, the exultation of the French over this
dashing victory was unspeakable; and it was commemorated
by the votaries of fashion in all sorts of ‘modes <i>à la Steinkirk</i>,’
the most captivating of which, we are told, was the loosely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>arranged and scarcely knotted cravats of white lace, worn
round the fair necks of Parisian beauties, in imitation of the
hasty toilettes of the young princes and nobles of the King’s
household troops.</p>

<p class='c035'>In Macaulay’s pathetic account of the last days of William
<span class='fss'>III.</span>, he tells us ‘there were in the crowd surrounding
the Monarch’s dying bed those who felt as no Englishman could
feel, friends of his youth, who had been true to him, and to
whom he had been true, through all vicissitudes of fortune,
who had served him with unalterable fidelity (when his
Secretaries of State, of his Treasury, and his Admiralty had
betrayed him), who had never on any field of battle, or in
an atmosphere tainted with loathsome and deadly disease,
shrunk from placing their own lives in jeopardy to save his,
and whose truth he had, at the cost of his own popularity,
rewarded with bounteous munificence.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Amid the group of his countrymen, the nearest to him was
Auverquerque, to whom he stretched out a feeble hand, thanking
him for the affectionate and loyal service of thirty years.</p>

<p class='c035'>After the King’s death Auverquerque felt no inclination to
remain in England, but returned to his native land, and once
more engaged in the war which was still waging against
France; and the States-General, in acknowledgment of his
services, bestowed on him the highest military honours, by
making him Field-Marshal of the whole army. He closed
his noble career by dying (as he had always desired) on
the field. The gallant Marshal had for some time suffered
from bad health, which he never allowed to interfere with his
duties. He died in the camp at Rouselaer, on the 17th day
of October 1708, after the battle of Lille. Collins gives a
detailed account of the funeral, with more than common
military honours, even for an officer of such exalted rank.
The funeral car was escorted by squadrons of life guards,
horse guards, and dragoons, the colours of the regiments, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>well as the men, being in mourning, two battalions of foot
guards, with arms reversed, etc. The body was followed for
a quarter of a league by a band of mourners, consisting of the
Marshal’s sons and most of the generals, headed by the Duke of
Marlborough. The troops were then drawn up, and saluted,
after which there was a triple discharge of cannon; the generals
returned to the camp, and the melancholy cortége passed on
towards the place of interment at Auverquerque.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Marshal married Isabella van Arsens, daughter of
Cornelius, Lord of Sommerdyke and Placata (who survived
him), by whom he had five sons and two daughters. The eldest
surviving son, Henry, was made an English peer in 1698, by the
title of Earl of Grantham, Viscount Boston, and Baron Alford.
He had to wife his cousin, Lady Henrietta Butler, daughter of
the celebrated Earl of Ossory (son to the first Duke of
Ormonde), by whom he had two sons and three daughters.
The youngest, Lady Henrietta Auverquerque, married William,
third Earl Cowper, and through this union the present noble
owner of Panshanger boasts a lineal descent from the hero,
William the Silent, and Maurice, Princes of Orange, whose
portraits Lady Henrietta brought into the Cowper family,
together with the splendid Vandyck of John of Nassau—purchased
by Lord Grantham at the Hague, in 1741, for the sum
of 5000 florins, from the Van Swieten collection,—also several
other Dutch pictures, which may be found in this Gallery.
From the aforesaid lady the present Lord Cowper derives his
title of Dingwall, though only called out of abeyance so
recently as 1880.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Albemarle, in his delightful volume entitled <i>Fifty
Years of My Life</i>, speaks in the highest terms of the valour
and generalship of Field-Marshal d’Auverquerque, and says
the history of the War of Succession best attests his merits
as General, and the Marlborough despatches best show the
estimation in which he was held by that consummate commander.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>The titles of Earl Grantham and Baron Alford were
bestowed upon him for his services, but he never assumed
these honours.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
A NATIVE of Rotterdam, the son of Martin
Van Tromp, who, at the age of eleven years,
stood by his father when he was shot down
in action, the boy crying wildly to his messmates,
‘Comrades, will you not revenge my
father’s death?’</p>

<p class='c035'>Martin’s father before him had also been killed on the
deck of his own vessel, in an engagement with the English,
and Cornelius proved himself worthy of his brave progenitors.
At the age of twenty-one he had attained the rank of post-captain,
and was employed against the Emperor of Morocco,
whom he compelled to make advantageous terms with the
Dutch. In 1652 he fought the English at Porto Longone,
and captured one of their finest vessels, the <i>Sampson</i>, which
he boarded, his own ship being disabled; but, to the great
mortification of Van Tromp, the <i>Sampson</i> was recaptured by
the enemy. The following year, in a fresh encounter with
the English, he made a violent effort to regain possession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>his former prize, but the <i>Sampson</i> was blown up. The Dutch
were victorious on this occasion, but they lost their Admiral,
and Van Tromp was promoted to the vacant post. In 1656,
in connection with Oldham and De Ruyter, he distinguished
himself on the high seas, and then retired for a while from
public life, and did not go afloat till 1662, when he fought
the Algerine pirates in the Mediterranean. He also performed
an arduous task in convoying several richly freighted
Dutch merchantmen from the East Indies safely into port, in
spite of numerous enemies who were on the look-out for such
valuable prizes. Van Tromp was constantly opposed to the
English, and in one engagement he gained universal praise
for the manner in which he defended his disabled and
shattered ship, when the Dutch were defeated, and sad
havoc made in their fleet. New ships had to be constructed
in all haste, and the States-General were placed in a dilemma
as to the appointment of the command of the naval forces.
Popular De Ruyter was absent, battling with other foes, and
although Van Tromp’s knowledge and skill were almost universally
acknowledged, there was a very powerful faction
against him, led by the brothers De Witt, then in the plenitude
of their power. The head and front of the gallant
seaman’s offending seemed to consist in his unswerving
loyalty to the House of Orange. There was, however, no
alternative, and the command of the fleet was grudgingly
bestowed on Cornelius Van Tromp, who had many hard
conditions, to which his patriotism alone induced him to
submit. He had not the sole command, but was joined therein
by De Witt and others, who received instructions to watch
over and supervise all his movements. Worse treatment was
in store for him; no sooner had he hoisted his flag, than the
sudden return of De Ruyter changed the whole aspect of
affairs; Van Tromp’s appointments were cancelled, and De
Ruyter ordered to supersede him. We can imagine with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>what feelings of wrathful indignation Van Tromp went on
shore, proudly refusing to serve under the man who had
supplanted him. In the ensuing year, spite of much bitterness
of feeling, he who had been so unjustly treated was
induced (partly by the bribe, perhaps, of a splendid ship)
to join De Ruyter in an attack on the English, when, after
a fierce struggle, of several days’ duration, the Dutch were
victorious. Hostilities continuing between the two nations,
in another engagement Van Tromp defeated the British
Admiral Smith, but De Ruyter was worsted; and on their
return violent recriminations passed between them. De
Ruyter complained that his colleague had acted quite independently,
had afforded him no support whatsoever, and, in
fact, had left him and his portion of the fleet completely in
the lurch, while Van Tromp retaliated with counter-charges.
The States-General, as usual, espoused the cause of De Ruyter,
deprived Van Tromp of his commission, forbade him to hold
any communication with the fleet, and placed him under provisory
arrest at the Hague. It was at this moment, while
smarting beneath the ingratitude and injustice of the country
which he had so nobly served, that tempting offers were made
to the gallant seaman to enter the service of France, but these
overtures were answered with becoming indignation. He now
gained permission to leave the Hague, and repair to a country house
which he possessed near Gravensand, called Trompenburg,
and built in the fanciful form of a man-of-war. But being
in the Hague at the time of the murder of the De Witt brothers,
there were slanderous rumours set abroad that he encouraged
the assassins. This arose doubtless from the fact that some
voices in the crowd on the day of the murder called out,
‘Down with the De Witts! Long live Van Tromp!’</p>

<p class='c035'>The Admiral remained for some time in retreat, but in
1673 he was reinstated in all his dignities by the Prince of
Orange (afterwards William <span class='fss'>III.</span>). A formal reconciliation took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>place between him and De Ruyter, and they once more agreed
to make common cause against the enemies of their country.
In an engagement with the combined forces of France and
England, Van Tromp was sorely pressed, compelled to change
his ship three times, and three times he was rescued by the
gallantry of De Ruyter. The war continued, and they were
both in constant service, and, whether successful or not, both
famed alike for their patriotism and courage.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1675, the Dutch being then at peace with England,
Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> invited Van Tromp to visit London, where he
welcomed him with great honour, and gave him the title of
Baron. The citizens also crowded to see the man whose
name, as well as that of his father, had long been used with
them as a bugbear to frighten naughty children (as was
the case with ‘Boney’ in later days), and whose advent on
the shores of England had at one time been so much
dreaded that prayers had actually been printed against such
a calamity.</p>

<p class='c035'>Next year the Admiral was despatched to the assistance
of Denmark against Sweden, and the King of that country
also did him great honour, creating him a Count, and decorating
him with the Order of the Elephant. On his return,
the death of De Ruyter had made a vacancy in the highest
naval command which it was in the power of the States-General
to bestow, and it was conferred on Van Tromp.
His last expedition was to accompany the Prince of Orange
in his attack of St. Omer, and in 1691, William (then King of
England) proposed to him to hoist his flag on the new fleet
equipping against France, but Van Tromp died before he
could undertake the trust. He expired at Amsterdam, and
was buried with great solemnity in the paternal mausoleum at
Delft.</p>

<p class='c035'>Cornelius Van Tromp, with many great qualities, had something
of a braggadocio in his nature. Witness his vain boast,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>when, after some successful encounter with the English, he
attached a broom to his main mast, at a time when our superiority
as a naval power was almost universally admitted.</p>

<p class='c035'>Van Tromp had one brother, and an only sister, who had
been christened by her father (in commemoration of one of
his victories, at the time of her birth) by the following names,
‘Anna Maria Victoria Hardensis Trompensis-Dunensis.’ We
sincerely hope, for the sake of her playmates, that the young
lady had at least one nickname.</p>

great namesake, Sir Joshua, by his beautiful

artists in oil and miniature, and his grandchildren still keep
up the character of the family for the love and practice of art.
Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds were intimate friends and constant

Hertford, where the agreeable and versatile talents of the

BORN at Plymouth, where his father, Samuel,
was master of the Grammar-School. His
mother was Theophila Potter, of Bishops
Plympton, South Molton, who had many
children. Samuel Reynolds was a good
man, and sensible withal; yet we are told, on
the authority of a maid who lived in the family, that he was
given to astrology, and would go out on the house-top to consult
the stars; moreover, that he once cast the horoscope of a
little daughter, for whom he predicted a violent death,—a prophecy
which was, unfortunately, fulfilled, as the child fell out
of a window, and was killed. When only eight years old,
Joshua had benefited so much by studying Richardson’s
treatise on Perspective, that he was enabled to draw the schoolhouse
according to rule, a feat which much delighted his
father. The boy also busied himself in copying all the engravings
he could lay hands on, more especially a volume of
Catt’s Emblems, which his grandmother had brought with her
from Holland. His sisters had all a turn for drawing, and the
little band of artists used to decorate the whitewashed walls of
the passages with designs in charcoal, whereof the least admired
were the brother’s handiworks. Indeed, in those days Joshua
was not considered a prophet by his sisters, who had nicknamed
him ‘The clown,’—a sobriquet certainly not applicable
to him in after life. Mrs. Parker, a friend and neighbour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the Reynolds family, sent the children a present of pencils,—a
gift which the great painter lived to pay back with interest,
for the walls of Saltram are rich in his paintings. When about
twelve years of age, Joshua is said to have made his first
essay in oils under considerable difficulties,—the portrait of
Richard (afterwards Lord) Edgecumbe,—in the boat-house on
Cremel Beach, below Mount Edgecumbe. This work was
executed on the rough canvas of a boat-sail, with the common
paints used by shipwrights!</p>

<p class='c035'>After much consultation with friends and relations, and
many pecuniary obstacles, Joshua proceeded to London as an
apprentice to Hudson, the fashionable portrait-painter of the
day, son-in-law to Richardson, whose writings on Art had been
so useful to the young beginner. Shortly after his departure, his
father writes to a friend that no one could be more delighted
than the dear fellow with his new life, his master, his employment,—indeed,
he was in the seventh heaven.</p>

<p class='c035'>Joshua was an enthusiast in all things, and a characteristic
anecdote is told of him when he first went to London. Hudson
sent him to a picture sale, on a commission to make a purchase,
when a whisper ran through the crowded room—‘Mr. Pope!
Mr. Pope!’ A passage was instantly made for the great man,
and Joshua, in a fever of excitement, stretched out his hand
under the arm of the person who stood before him, desirous
even to touch the hem of the poet’s garment. To his delight,
his hand was warmly shaken by the man whose homely but
expressive features, and poetical creations, he was destined to
portray in later days.</p>

<p class='c035'>Reynolds left Hudson’s studio before his apprenticeship had
expired, for which step many reasons were assigned at the
time by those who, perhaps, were not in possession of the truth.
Some said his master was unkind to him, from a feeling of
jealousy; but as both father and son (Reynolds) remained on
friendly terms with the painter, this does not appear probable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Joshua went down to Plymouth, and painted all the remarkable
people in the neighbourhood, including the greatest dignitary of
all,—the Commissioner of the dockyard!</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1746 his father died, and when the household broke up,
he went to live with his two unmarried sisters at Plymouth. It
was here he made the acquaintance of Commodore Keppel,
whose portrait is so well known and so justly admired. This
gallant sailor had been appointed to the command of the
Mediterranean Fleet, and intrusted with a diplomatic mission,
before he had completed his twenty-fourth year. He met
Joshua at Mount Edgecumbe, and proposed to take him for a
cruise, an offer that was gladly accepted. After visiting Portugal,
the Balearic Isles, and different portions of the Italian
coast, the young painter took leave of the Commodore, and
proceeded on a prolonged tour through all the principal
towns of Italy, carefully admiring, studying, copying, and
writing essays on all the treasures of art in his progress. His
long and patient worship of Raphael, in the chambers of the
Vatican, cost him one of his senses, for the extreme cold of
those vast apartments brought on a chill, which deprived him
of hearing, even at that early age. Returning to London, he
established himself in St. Martin’s Lane, in a house formerly
occupied by Sir James Thornhill, immediately behind which
stood the school for drawing and design. He now wrote to
his sister Frances to come up from Devonshire, and keep house
for him,—a proceeding which, judging from the character given
of that lady by Madame D’Arblay (whose testimony we are
always inclined to take <i>cum grano</i>), appeared to be of questionable
advantage, for Miss Fanny, though a person of worth and
understanding, lived in a perpetual state of irresolution of
mind and perplexity of conduct,—what in these days we should
call a chronic fuss; added to which, she insisted on being an
artist, and her admiration for her brother’s works induced her
to make what she called ‘copies,’ and Joshua ‘caricatures.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>‘Indeed,’ said he wofully, ‘Fanny’s copies make me cry, and
other people laugh.’ She had also a knack of taking offence on
the slightest provocation, and one day, being displeased with
her brother for some imaginary slight put upon her, she
deputed Samuel Johnson to compose an expostulatory letter
for her to write to Joshua. Dr. Johnson was a warm admirer
of Miss Fanny and her talent for tea-making,—to which he did
full justice,—and could deny her nothing; but when the copy of
the letter was read and discussed, the style was so unmistakably
masculine and Johnsonian, that it was deemed advisable not to
send it.</p>

<p class='c035'>Our painter’s hands were now full. Men and women of all
classes, denominations, and reputations, thronged his studio;
his pocket-book was a perfect record of all the illustrious and
celebrated names of the period. He determined to change
his quarters, first to Newport Street, and finally to far more
commodious apartments in Leicester Square. He raised his
prices, charging twelve guineas for a head, and forty-eight for
a full-length. He set up a magnificent coach, which caused
a great sensation. Northcote flippantly describes it as an
advertisement; but it would appear more likely that Reynolds
wished to do Catton a good turn. Catton had begun life as
a decorator, and ended as an R.A. The vehicle was splendid
in colour and gorgeous in gilding, and Catton soon received
orders to paint royal and municipal carriages. Joshua was
far too busy to take the air in his new equipage, and it was in
vain he entreated Miss Fanny to do so. She was much too
shy, she said, to attract the eyes of the whole town.</p>

<p class='c035'>We do not require to be told that Sir Joshua was a friend
and playfellow of children. None but a lover could have
painted in all their winning varieties, not merely the comeliness,
but the roguish grace, the dimpled smiles, the ‘beautifully
shy’ glances, of childhood. It is easy to picture him paying
court to these juvenile charmers, and entering into delightful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>small flirtations. But the history of one of these tender passages
will suffice to give an idea of the course he usually pursued.
The parents of the beautiful little Miss Bowles, with whose
sweet face we are all familiar, had settled that their darling
should sit to Romney. But Sir George Beaumont recommended
Reynolds for the privilege. The little lady was shy and coy.
‘Invite him to dinner,’ said Sir George. The President came,
and sat at table by the daughter of the house. He paid her
the most assiduous court; no end of stories; no end of tricks;
her plate was juggled away and brought back from unexpected
quarters. Her senses were dazzled; the conquest was complete;
she thought him the most captivating of men, and was only
too ready to be taken to his house next day. There, seated on
the floor in an ecstasy of expectation and delight, she gave herself
up to Sir Joshua’s fascinations. He seized his opportunity,
caught the radiant expression, fastened it on the canvas, and
made his little friend immortal! No one gloried more in the
success of the young painter than Samuel Johnson, for
between these two great men, so essentially different in pursuits,
in character, intellect, and appearance, a tender friendship
had sprung up. Reynolds’s heart, home, and purse were
always at the service of the Doctor, who was often in pecuniary
difficulties, and who wrote <i>Rasselas</i> under the pressure of great
sorrow, paying the expenses of his mother’s funeral out of the
proceeds of the book. He puts these touching words into the
mouth of Imlac: ‘I have neither mother to delight in the reputation
of her son, or wife to share in the honours of her husband.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Many a delightful summer excursion did Johnson and
Reynolds make together, where the eccentricities and caustic
humour of the former made him as welcome a guest at the
country houses they visited as the refined qualities and
polished manners of the latter.</p>

<p class='c035'>If the peculiarities, the sayings, and doings of the great
‘leviathan of literature’ have been made familiar to us by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>pen of Boswell, surely the pencil of Reynolds has stamped
his image on our minds, as if the living Samuel had ever stood
before us. Boswell recognised the Doctor when he saw him first
through a glass door in Tom Davies’s coffee-house from his
exact resemblance to the portrait which the painter afterwards
gave the biographer, who had it engraved for one of the
first editions of Johnson’s Life. What can be more charming
than ‘The Infant Johnson,’ one of the chief glories of the Bowood
collection? Was ever a joke so wonderfully delineated?</p>

<p class='c035'>The question being raised one evening at a convivial
meeting, Could the Doctor ever have been a baby? ‘No
doubt about it,’ said Reynolds; ‘I know exactly what he
looked like, and I will show you some day.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The painter was a great admirer of Johnson’s powers of
conversation, and it was chiefly at his instigation that the
Literary Club was formed, with a view ‘of giving the Doctor the
opportunity of talking, and us, his friends, of listening.’ The
meetings were held in Gerrard Street, Soho, and were at first
confined to twelve members, but ere long included all the wit
and literature of the town.</p>

<p class='c035'>Sir Joshua liked cards, masquerades, and theatres. Neither
did he disdain the illegitimate drama, for we find him accompanying
the sapient Samuel and the rollicking Oliver (Goldsmith)
to a performance of the Italian Fantoccini; and, still
more surprising, we have the account of the supper which
crowned this convivial evening, when Goldsmith and the
Doctor jumped over sticks, in imitation of the frolics of the
wooden puppets, and the latter nearly broke his leg in these
elephantine gambols!</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1769 the Royal Academy was founded. Joshua did
not join the deputation that waited on the King; in fact, he
kept aloof from the whole undertaking, interested as he was at
heart in the cause; but the slights put upon him at Court
formed a sufficient reason for his non-appearance. From the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>moment that he found himself elected President by the unanimous
voice of his brother artists, his zeal never slackened,
and knew no bounds. He drew up Regulations, wrote and
revised the Catalogue, and began a regular course of lectures,
which gained him as much literary, as his paintings had secured
for him pictorial, fame. As long as Reynolds could hold a
brush he contributed his most splendid portraits to the Exhibitions.
As in duty bound, he went to the levee, where the
King knighted him. ‘His very name,’ says his friend Edmund
Burke, an undoubted master of euphony, ‘seemed made for
knightly honours.’</p>

<p class='c035'>George <span class='fss'>III.</span> sat to him for the presentation picture to the
Royal Academy. Sir Joshua had not as much time now as
formerly for his summer excursions, whether in England or
abroad. He spent most of the day in his painting-room, or in
attending to his numerous duties as P.R.A. In the evening he
gave himself up more or less to social enjoyment, dining out constantly
at clubs or private houses, or presiding at his own table
at those convivial banquets, where oftentimes half a dozen
guests were expected and a dozen appeared, and where verily
the feast of reason and the flow of soul made up for the scarcity
of the servants, knives, forks, plates, and such minor details.</p>

<p class='c035'>In that dining-room were gathered all the intellect and
wit of the town; and its noble master presided calmly, taking
an interest in all that came within the range of his ear-trumpet.
Leicester Square was in the centre of the disturbed district at
the time of the Gordon Riots, and the noise and hubbub were
painfully audible to the painter’s impaired hearing, and for a
time interfered with the visits of his fair sitters. On St.
George’s Day 1770, Sir Joshua presided at the first Royal
Academy banquet, a festivity which was spoiled for many of
the guests by the announcement that the boy-poet Chatterton
had committed suicide.</p>

<p class='c035'>In the ensuing year Reynolds was summoned to Windsor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Castle to witness the installation of nine Knights of the
Garter, all of whom (with the exception of two foreign
Princes) had been immortalised by his pencil. Northcote tells
us that on this occasion Sir Joshua lost his laced hat and
gold watch in the crowd close to the Royal precincts,—a circumstance
which excited little astonishment in days when a
boat containing ladies and gentlemen from Vauxhall was
boarded by masked highwaymen!</p>

<p class='c035'>A delightful addition was made in 1771 to the Leicester
Square household, in the person of his pretty niece, Theophila
Palmer; and two years later she was joined by her sister, Mary,
adding that element of youth, beauty, and good spirits which
were most acceptable to Sir Joshua himself and to all his
guests. A sad blow was in store for him in the death of his
valued friend David Garrick, who was taken ill when on a
visit to Lord Spencer at Althorp, and only returned to London
to die. The whole Faculty put forth their skill to save
this darling of the public, this cherished member of private
society; but in vain. Garrick’s humour never forsook
him; when almost at the point of death, he drew a friend
near him, and, pointing to the crowd of doctors in the room,
whispered these words from the ‘Fair Penitent’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Another and another still succeeds,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And the last fool is welcome as the former.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>David Garrick’s funeral was a pageant. The procession
included every name remarkable for talent, rank, celebrity of
all kinds and classes. But amidst that crowd of mourners
few could have grieved more deeply than the actor’s fast friend,
Joshua Reynolds.</p>

<p class='c035'>He was indeed a good friend, and was much interested
in the unhappy Angelica Kauffmann, whom he assisted in
the dissolution of her marriage with her first husband, a
swindler and an impostor. We find by his pocket-book that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>she sat twice to him, and in exchange she afterwards
painted the P.R.A. for Mr. Parker of Saltram. There was
a rumour that the painter’s heart was touched by the charms
of the paintress. But Joshua was evidently not very susceptible;
he was an inveterate club man, and was immensely
popular, from the geniality and cordiality of his manners, as
also (it was whispered) from the badness of his whist-playing.
He was elected for the Dilettanti Club in 1766, and his picture
of the assembled members was greatly admired, and
added considerably to his fame.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1782 the great painter had a paralytic seizure, though
of a mild nature, and he soon recovered sufficient energy
to continue his labours, with, if possible, increased diligence,
finishing and exhibiting some of his noblest works after this
premonitory warning. In 1784 Samuel Johnson was stricken
down by the same terrible disease, but in a much more aggravated
form, leaving little hope of his recovery. He had lost
the power of speech for a time, and his first efforts at returning
articulation were to repeat the Lord’s Prayer, and an earnest
supplication that his intellect might be spared to the last,
together with a summons to his dear Joshua,—the loved companion
of so many pleasant excursions, of so many jovial and
intellectual gatherings,—of whom he took a tender farewell.
The dying man made three requests in that solemn moment:
that Reynolds would paint no more on Sundays; that he
would invariably read his Bible on that day, and other days
besides; and that he would cancel the debt of £30 which
he (Johnson) owed him.</p>

<p class='c035'>The relations between Gainsborough and Reynolds had
never been very friendly; but when the first-mentioned painter
was on his deathbed, he also sent for Sir Joshua, who says:
‘In those solemn moments all little jealousies were forgotten,
and he recognised in me one whose tastes and pursuits were
in common with his own, and of whose works he approved.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>It should be remembered that when Gainsborough heard some
one disparaging Sir Joshua’s talent, he spoke up gallantly, and
said, ‘For myself, I consider his worst pictures superior to the
best of any other painter;’ and words nearly to the same
effect, on the same subject, are recorded of Romney. Reynolds
himself, being attacked on the score of his portraits fading,
laughed, and said good-humouredly, ‘Well, you must confess
at all events that I have come off with <i>flying</i> colours.’ On the
death of Ramsay, the Court painter, the post was offered to
Sir Joshua, but it required the united persuasions of his friends
to induce him to accept the office.</p>

<p class='c035'>Reynolds had a great deal to contend with in these latter
days. He had entirely lost the sight of one eye, and was under
grave apprehensions for the safety of the other; while the
conduct of many of the Royal Academicians towards their
noble President was such as to determine him to resign his
post. The King (who had just recovered from an attack of
insanity) exerted himself to persuade Reynolds to take back
his resignation. But it was not until he had received a deputation
from the Council, accompanied by apologies from some
of the offenders, that Sir Joshua consented to resume the
Chair. In December 1790 he delivered his last discourse at
the Royal Academy, which he commenced by alluding slightly
and delicately to the causes which had nearly prevented his
ever occupying that place again, and assuring his hearers that
he should always remember with pride, affection, and gratitude
the support with which he had almost uniformly been honoured
since the commencement of their intercourse. He enjoined,
for the last time, the enforcement of those rules which he considered
conducive to the wellbeing of the institution.</p>

<p class='c035'>Every eye was fixed on the speaker, every ear open to his
charming, when suddenly a loud crash plunged the whole
assembly (with the exception of the President) into alarm and
confusion. There was a general rush to the door, but when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>order was restored, and assurance of safety believed, it was
ascertained that a beam, which helped to support the flooring,
had given way.</p>

<p class='c035'>Alas for the omen! The greatest prop to the grandeur
of the Royal Academy was soon to fall away in truth.</p>

<p class='c035'>Sir Joshua remained calm and unmoved during the perturbation,
and concluded by these words: ‘I reflect, not without
vanity, that these discourses bear testimony to my
admiration of a truly divine man, and I desire that the last
words I pronounce in this Academy should be the name
of Michael Angelo.’</p>

<p class='c035'>As Reynolds descended from the Chair, Edmund Burke
stepped forward, and, taking his hand, addressed him in the
words of Milton:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The angel ended, and in Adam’s ear</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So charming left his voice, that he a while</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thought him still speaking, and stood fixed to hear.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>‘Such a tribute, from such a man,’ says Leslie, ‘was a fitting
close to the life-work of Joshua Reynolds.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Neither his impaired sight, his deficient hearing, or his
increasing weakness, could entirely damp the warmth of his
social affections. The last time he wielded his brush was
at the request of some schoolboys, who entreated him to paint
them a flag for ‘breaking up.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Reynolds had that love for children and domestic pets
which seems inseparable from great and good natures. He
would pay the most assiduous court, and make the most gallant
advances, to some of the exquisite little models who sat to him,
till they became spellbound. And one day, his canary having
escaped from its cage, nothing would content the P.R.A.
but he must go out into the glaring sunshine, with his weak
eyes, and the green shade over them, to spend hours in
seeking and whistling for his lost favourite.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>The end was approaching. His spirits became depressed,
his appetite failed, and on the evening of February 23, 1792,
he concluded a blameless life by a calm and peaceful end.
The manuscript of Burke’s obituary notice still exists,
blotted with the writer’s tears. It was written in the very
house where the friends had spent so many happy hours
together. Beautiful in its touching eloquence, we regret we
have only space for a short extract:—</p>

<p class='c035'>‘From the beginning Sir Joshua contemplated his dissolution
with a composure which nothing but the innocence,
integrity, and usefulness of his life, and his entire submission
to the will of Providence, could bestow. In the full affluence
of foreign and domestic fame, admired by the expert in art,
by the learned in science, caressed by sovereign powers, and
celebrated by distinguished poets, his native humility, modesty,
and candour never forsook him. He had too much merit
ever to excite jealousy, too much innocence ever to provoke
enmity. The loss of no man of his time can be felt with so
much sincere, general, and unmixed sorrow.’ And these
words were confirmed by the crowds of every calling, position,
and class which followed him to the grave.</p>

<p class='c035'>The body lay in state at Somerset House. There were
ninety-one carriages followed, so that, before the first in the
line had reached St. Paul’s, the last was still at the entrance
of Somerset House. The Annual Register for that year gives
a detailed account of the funeral. The pall-bearers were ten
Peers, Reynolds’s personal friends, the greater part of whom
had been his sitters. And the procession included three
Knights of the Garter, two of St. Patrick, and one of the
Thistle; three Dukes and four Lords-Lieutenant of Ireland;
the whole body of Academicians, painters, authors, actors,—every
name distinguished for literature, art, and science. Sir
Joshua left numerous legacies; many of his finest pictures
were bequeathed to private friends.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>He left the bulk of his fortune, for her life, to his sister,
Frances Reynolds, with reversion to his niece, Mary Palmer,
afterwards Lady Thomond, together with a large collection
of his paintings, which were sold and dispersed at her
death.</p>

<p class='c035'>The number of his paintings seems miraculous when the list
is read. He was a large contributor to the Exhibitions of the
Royal Academy. At the first of these he sent four; at the last
(as far as he was concerned, in 1790) he sent but six, only
two years before his death. But in the interim his pictures
often numbered fourteen, sixteen, and, on one occasion, seventeen,
for his talent was only equalled by his industry, and he
was a workman as well as an artist, to which fact all his contemporaries
bear witness.</p>

WE give a sketch of both sisters, not being quite
certain as to the identity of the portrait.
They were the daughters of Mrs. Palmer,
who was sister of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and
wife of John Palmer of Torrington, county
Devon. Theophila, their youngest daughter,
had been residing some time with her uncle in Leicester
Square, but came home for change of air; and when she returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>to London in 1779, her elder sister, Mary, accompanied
her. Miss Burney tells us that the two sisters ‘added to the
charm of the President’s table and his evening parties by their
pleasing manners and the beauty of their persons.’</p>

<p class='c035'>They both served as occasional models. Mary appears to
have been the more staid and demure of the two. She had
the keenest admiration and appreciation of her uncle’s talent,
and never tired of describing his works to her frequent correspondent
and cousin, William Johnson, at Calcutta. In 1786
she says: ‘Uncle seems more than ever bewitched by his
palette and pencil. He paints from morning till night, and,
truth to say, each picture appears better than the last. The
Empress of Russia has ordered an historical painting; his
choice is still undecided.’</p>

<p class='c035'>This was the ‘Infant Hercules,’ which made such a noise at
the time, and the merits of which were the subject of so much
controversy. Romney’s verdict was ‘that, whatever fault
might be found with it, no other painter in Europe could have
produced that picture.’ Sir Joshua was one of those who did
not disdain criticism, even from young lips. He had painted
a captivating portrait of Mary’s little niece, Polly Gwatkin, and
when Miss Palmer saw it she told the President boldly that
the little fingers, which were clasped on the child’s lap, with
their very red tips, suggested the idea of a dish of prawns!
Sir Joshua, no ways offended, laughed, and set to work immediately,
turning the prawns into roseate buds, which he
placed in the little chubby hand. Mary was at Torrington
when she heard of her uncle’s sudden failure of sight and loss
of one eye. She hastened back to his side, to read, to write,
to minister to him in every possible way, for he was not
allowed to read, or write, or paint for some time. ‘You may
believe,’ Mary writes, ‘what the loss of an eye is to him. But
his serenity never forsook him. One of his early axioms was
not to fuss about trifles,—if the loss of an eye could be considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>as such. ‘The ruling passion continues. He amuses
himself by mending or cleaning a picture. In the meantime
he enjoys company as much as ever, and loves a game at cards.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Mary Palmer lived with her uncle till his death. He left
her a considerable fortune and a large collection of his pictures,
which were sold by auction at her death, in 1821. The same
year that Sir Joshua died she married Murrough, first Marquis
of Thomond, as his second wife. She made a present of
one of his historical paintings to George <span class='fss'>IV.</span> Theophila, or
Offy, as her uncle usually called her, was his favourite,
although much attached to both sisters. She was only thirteen
when she first went to live in Leicester Square. She was very
pretty, and full of fun and playful spirits. She frequently sat to
the President, especially for his arch and sprightly models,—his
‘Strawberry Girl,’ his ‘Mouse Girl,’ and ‘Reflections on reading
<i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>.’ But Miss Offy’s dignity was much hurt on
the exhibition of the last-named picture, because it was entered
into the Catalogue as ‘A Girl reading:’ ‘You might have put “a
young lady,” uncle’! Another time the President was scolded
because he made the portrait look too young, when the
original was nearly fourteen! But for all these differences, the
great man and the little lady were the dearest friends, and we
find in one of his long letters that he will not tell her how
much he loves her lest she should grow saucy over it; and
again he says he has two presents for her and Mary,—a ring,
and a bracelet of his hair. She is to have her choice, but she
is not to let her sister know of this mark of preference.</p>

<p class='c035'>Offy was married in her twentieth year, from her mother’s
house at Torrington, to Richard Lovell Gwatkin, a man of
fortune, and of a good Cornish family. Her uncle writes her
a most affectionate letter of congratulation, with a postscript
by Edmund Burke, who came in at the moment, wishing her
every possible happiness. The wish was fulfilled. There
never was a happier wife or mother than little Offy. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>came to London and sat for a conjugal picture to Sir Joshua,
who also painted her little daughter, as we have said before.
Mrs. Gwatkin lived to be ninety years of age, surrounded by
her children’s children.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE grandson of Spencer Cowper, Attorney-General,
and great-nephew of Lord Chancellor
Cowper, the first peer of the name.
His father was Dr. John Cowper, chaplain
to King George <span class='fss'>II.</span>, who married the
daughter of Roger Donne, of Lidham Hall,
county Norfolk. William, the eldest of two sons, was born
at his father’s rectory of Great Berkhamstead.</p>

<p class='c035'>Mrs. Cowper died in giving birth to a second son. She
was an amiable and pretty woman, and much more deserving
of the flattering epitaph (by her niece, Lady Walsingham) than
most objects of elegiac praise, in the days when it might well
be asked ‘where all the naughty people were buried.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Even in these times when ‘The Task’ and the Homer lie
unopened on the table, few readers of poetry are surely unacquainted
with the ‘Address to my Mother’s Picture,’ written
half a century after her death. The portrait was a present to
William Cowper, from his cousin, Mrs. Bodham, and he writes
her an enthusiastic letter of thanks ‘for the most acceptable
gift the world could offer;’ sending her at the same time the
lines to which we have alluded. ‘I have placed the painting
so as to meet my eye the first thing in the morning, and the
last at night, and I often get up from my bed to kiss it.’</p>

<p class='c035'>But we must not anticipate by so many years. When only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>six, William went to a large school at Markgate Street, where
he had to undergo a fierce ordeal. Many a stout-hearted boy,
possessing the germs of future heroism, might have quailed
before the bully who marked the little sensitive, tender-hearted
Willie (ready to burst into tears at the first harsh word) as his
victim. He tells us himself that he scarcely ever dared to
lift his eyes above the level of his tyrant’s shoe-buckle; and,
alluding to those days in later life, he said he could not dwell
on the cruelty practised on him, but he hoped God would
forgive his tormentor, and that they might meet in heaven.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Wretch even then, life’s journey just begun.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>It is easy to see how the memory of those days suggested
his ‘Tyrocinium.’ Mr. Cowper, finding that the boy was suffering
from inflammation of the eyes, sent him to board with an
oculist in London, and afterwards to Westminster School,
where William improved in health, and took bodily exercise,
cricket and football, which proved beneficial to him in more
ways than one, making him popular in the school.</p>

<p class='c035'>He was diligent in his study of the Classics, and wrote
good Latin verses. Warren Hastings was his contemporary
and friend, and Cowper would never listen in after days to
a word against his old school-fellow.</p>

<p class='c035'>On leaving Westminster, he became articled clerk to an
attorney, in obedience to his father’s wishes, he himself disliking
the profession of the law. He confesses that at this
period he spent most of his time ‘in giggling and making
giggle’ his two favourite cousins, Theodora and Harriet,
daughters of Ashley Cowper. He ‘feared some day that
worthy gentleman would be picked up for a mushroom,
being a diminutive man, nearly hidden under the shadow of
a white broad-brimmed hat, lined with yellow.’ His fellow-clerk
and ally in these giggling matches was the afterwards
famous Lord Thurlow, of whom it was said, ‘No man could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>possibly be as wise as Lord Thurlow looked.’ At all events
he was wise enough at this period to combine legal study
with flirtation. Cowper prophesied he would one day sit on
the Woolsack, and Thurlow promised to do something handsome
for his friend whenever that time should come. He
redeemed his pledge by the gift of a few strictures and
criticisms on the poet’s translation of Homer.</p>

<p class='c035'>Cowper removed from the attorney’s office to chambers
in the Temple, where he studied literature rather than law,
and became a member of the Nonsense Club, which was the
resort of authors, journalists, editors, and the like. Here he
formed many friendships which lasted through life, became
a contributor to several periodicals, kept up his classical
reading, translated many amatory and sentimental poems,
and wrote odes to Delia of a very tender character,—Delia
otherwise Theodora Cowper.</p>

<p class='c035'>The cousins had fallen in love, but the lady’s father would
not hear of the marriage, which was a bitter disappointment.
The lady remained faithful to her first love, and Cowper, as
we know, never married.</p>

<p class='c035'>A cousin of William’s, Major Cowper, had the patronage
of the Clerkship of Journals in the House of Lords; and the
future poet, whose finances were very low at the time, one
day expressed a hope that the holder of the office might die,
in order to make way for him. This uttered wish was afterwards
the subject of due remorse to this sensitive spirit: ‘God
gave me my heart’s desire, and sent leanness withal into my
soul.’ The man died, the office was offered to, and accepted
by, Cowper. ‘I was so dazzled,’ he said, ‘by the idea, that
I did not reflect on my incapacity for the appointment;’ but
as he answered in the affirmative, he felt ‘a dagger strike at
his heart.’ He fell a prey to nervous fears and terrors of all
kinds, and, even while preparing himself for the duties of his
office, began to contemplate with horror the prospect of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>examined as to his proficiency at the bar of the House of
Lords.</p>

<p class='c035'>By degrees he became quite mad, and in that state meditated
self-destruction. He bought laudanum, he drove to the
river-side to drown himself, he pointed a knife at his throat;
but his courage always failed him, or, as he thought, some
particular interposition saved his life. Twice he suspended
himself by the neck long enough to occasion insensibility,
but so insecurely as to fall each time, the shock bringing
back consciousness. After this last incident he sent for a
relative, to whom he confessed everything, and who, comprehending
the state of the case, returned the nomination to
Major Cowper.</p>

<p class='c035'>Several of his friends, unacquainted with these sad circumstances,
called upon him on the day appointed for his appearance
at the House of Lords, but one and all acquiesced in
the sad decision that he must be placed under restraint. The
asylum chosen was that of Dr. Cotton, a religious and well-educated
man, who was of much service to the sufferer by his
judicious treatment. William laboured under terrible despondency,
fear of eternal punishment, and the deepest feelings of
remorse. By the gentle, friendly care of Dr. Cotton, the
patient gradually regained his health, both mental and bodily,
and took much comfort in reading the Bible,—the very book
which, in his fits of madness, he would dash to the ground.
One morning, studying the third chapter of Romans, he
experienced ‘comfort and strength to believe, feeling the full
beams of the Sun of Righteousness shining on me, and relying
on the full justification by faith in the blood of Jesus. In a
moment I believed, and received the Gospel.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The seeds of religion, which bore fruit in Cowper’s after
life, had been in some measure sown by the hand of the good
physician Dr. Cotton, and, after eleven months’ sojourn at
St. Albans, William Cowper went forth in his right mind.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>After much consultation between the brothers, an abode
was fixed upon for William Cowper at what one of his biographers
designates as ‘dull, fenny Huntingdon,’ which
appeared an Elysium to one who had just recovered his
senses and his liberty. He had not been there long before
an incident occurred which changed the whole tenor of his
after life. Leaving church one morning, he began pacing up
and down under the shade of the trees, before returning to
his solitary lodging, when he was accosted by a young man of
prepossessing appearance, who craved pardon for addressing
‘a perfect stranger,’ and asked leave to accompany him in his
walk. Such an unconventional proceeding was doubtless
calculated to please a man of so imaginative a turn of mind,
and Cowper warmly responded. The young man announced
himself as William Unwin, a student of Cambridge, the
son of the Rev. Mr. Unwin, who lived in the town, and
boarded pupils for the Huntingdon school. Young Unwin
went on to confess that, for some time past, he had been
attracted by Cowper’s appearance, and longed to speak to him,
but to-day he could no longer resist doing so. He ended by
requesting his new friend to accompany him home, that he
might make acquaintance with his parents. No time was lost,
the visit was paid; the liking proved reciprocal, and it was not
long before William Cowper left his lonely apartments to
occupy a room, lately vacated, under the roof of the Rev. Mr.
Unwin. Thus began that lifelong friendship, the annals of
which are indissolubly connected with the poet’s history.
‘Verily there is One who setteth the solitary in families.’
Writing to his dear cousin and constant correspondent, Lady
Hesketh (the sister of Theodora), he described ‘the most
comfortable and sociable folk he had ever met,—the son,
destined for the Church, most frank and unreserved; the girl
pretty, bashful, taciturn; the father a kind of Parson Adams,
and the mother.’ Mrs. Unwin was some years younger than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>her husband, comely in appearance, strongly imbued with
evangelical views in religion, well read, particularly in the
English poets, with a vein of cheerfulness and humour
tempering the strictness of her religious tenets, and an
invaluable critic. Cowper describes a two hours’ walk and
conversation with her, which did him ‘more good than an
audience with a prince could have done. Her society is
a real blessing to me.’ The manner of life in the Unwin
establishment proved most congenial to Cowper’s tastes, for
he both contemned and condemned ‘the frivolous gaieties,
the balls, routs, and card-parties of the Huntingdon <i>beau
monde</i>.’ ‘After early breakfast,’ he says, ‘we occupy ourselves
in reading passages from Scripture, or the works of some
favourite preacher; at eleven, Divine service, which is performed
twice a day; a solitary ride, walk, or reading; and
after dinner a sociable walk in the garden with mother or son,
the conversation usually of a religious character.’ Mrs. Unwin
was a good walker, and the friends often rambled beyond the
home precincts, and did not return till tea-time; at night,
reading or singing hymns till supper; family prayers concluded
the order of the day. This was the description by William
Cowper of a day of perfect cheerfulness. With all our admiration
for the man who was thus spiritually minded, it is almost
a relief to find him confessing to some slight shade of human
weakness in a letter to his cousin, Mrs. Cowper. He had
given young Unwin an introduction to ‘the Park,’ and—after
a lengthened rhapsody of self-accusation, not without a spice
of humour, as of one who is laughing at himself,—he allows
that ‘it was not alone friendship for the youth which prompted
the introduction, but a desire that Unwin should receive some
convincing proof of “my <i>sponsibility</i>,” by visiting one of my
most splendid connections, so that, when next he hears me
called “that fellow Cowper” (which has happened before now),
he may be able to bear witness to my gentlemanhood.’</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>About this time he seems to have revolved in his mind
the idea of taking orders, which he wisely abandoned. He
had spent but two peaceful years under his friends’ roof, when
the home was broken up by the death of Mr. Unwin, who fell
from his horse and fractured his skull, riding home after
church. ‘This event necessitates a change of residence,’
Cowper remarks. But the possibility of a separation from
Mrs. Unwin never appears to have struck either of them;
they merely commenced making inquiries and taking advice
as to whither they should flit. The poet’s biographers are at
variance respecting this epoch in his life, some asserting,
others denying, that the friends ever contemplated marriage.
There must have been some rumour to this effect, as, in a
postscript to one of his letters he says laconically, ‘I am not
married.’ He frequently remarked that the affection Mrs.
Unwin bore him was that of a mother for a son; nevertheless,
the lady was only his senior by seven years.</p>

<p class='c035'>To the eye of watchful affection, it was evident that
Cowper’s mental recovery would not prove permanent, and
such a consideration doubtless weighed in the devoted
woman’s resolution to remain at her friend’s side. Her son,
a religious and high-principled man, offered no objection; her
daughter was married; and so William Cowper and Mary
Unwin took up their abode together in the melancholy little
town of Olney, in Buckinghamshire. They were attracted to
this unpromising locality by one of those hasty friendships to
which they were both prone. The Rev. Mr. Newton, at that
time esteemed a shining light in Methodist circles—well known
by his <i>Cardiphonia</i> and many evangelical works, and still
better, perhaps, by his collection of ‘Olney Hymns’—had
visited the Unwins at Huntingdon, and had held discussions
with them on religious matters, in a strain much appreciated by
the whole household. He was now curate at Olney, and
invited his new friends to settle near him. This remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>man had passed a stormy and eventful youth. He had been a
sailor in all parts of the world; had endured shipwreck, slavery,
imprisonment, and perils of all kinds, by land and by sea.
He had become a minister of the Gospel, and was one of those
enthusiasts who, after a sudden conversion (generally brought
about by a lightning flash of conviction), take delight in reviling
their former selves, painting their own portraits in colours
so black as to bring out in stronger relief the subsequent
brightness. He was a zealot, and had the reputation of
‘preaching people mad.’ Alas! such a man, however conscientious
and well-intentioned, was one of the worst influences
that could have crossed Cowper’s path. But so it was. Mr.
Newton hired a house for the new-comers next door to the
Vicarage where he lived,—damp, dark, and dreary; even the
easily-contented and far from luxurious poet described it as a
‘well’ and an ‘abyss.’ Then the life prescribed by this
spiritual pastor and master,—prayer-meetings at all hours of
the day and evening; rigid self-examinations and upbraidings;
scarcely any leisure allowed for wholesome exercise or cheerful
correspondence.</p>

<p class='c035'>Mrs. Unwin, usually watchful and judicious, was herself
so completely under Newton’s influence, that she did
not interfere to arrest the progress of a system which was
helping to hurry her poor friend back into his former miserable
state. Before the malady returned in its most aggravated form,
Cowper used to take violent fancies, and one day suddenly
insisted on leaving his own house and removing to the Vicarage,—a
most inconvenient resolution, as far as the curate was
concerned. John Cowper’s death, about this time, helped
to agitate his brother’s mind, and ere long he was again
insane.</p>

<p class='c035'>When the dark hour came, the devoted woman and the
benevolent though mistaken friend were unremitting in their
care; and it was in allusion to the tenderness with which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>his gentle-hearted nurse ministered to him on this and
subsequent occasions that Cowper wrote:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>‘There is a book</div>
      <div class='line'>By seraphs writ in beams of heavenly light,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>On which the eyes of God not rarely look;</div>
      <div class='line'>A chronicle of actions just and bright.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Here all thy deeds, my faithful Mary, shine,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And since thou own’st that praise, I spare thee mine.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>Mr. Newton was soon to leave Olney, which he did under
circumstances that appear, at this time of writing, rather
comic. He had a great dread of fire, and strictly prohibited
every species of bonfire, illumination, or firework in the
locality on Gunpowder Plot Day. Such an inroad on a time-honoured
institution could not be tolerated. The parish rose
<i>en masse</i>, and his reverence narrowly escaped with his life.
Disgusted by the ingratitude and rebellion of his flock, the
curate removed to London.</p>

<p class='c035'>Cowper had before this returned to his own house, and
gradually his bodily health improved and his mind regained
its equilibrium; he now began to resume out-of-doors
pursuits, walking and gardening, and the like. He was much
addicted to reading out of doors, and said that external
objects fixed the subject of his lecture on his memory. He
wrote to William Unwin about this time, requesting him to
procure a diamond for cutting glass, and expatiating at length
on the joys of a glazier’s trade. He hardly knows a business
in which a gentleman might more successfully employ himself.
‘Possibly the happy time may come,’ he goes on to say, ‘when
I may be seen trudging off to the neighbouring towns, with
a shelf of glass hanging at my back. A Chinese of ten times
my fortune would avail himself of such an opportunity,—and
why not I, who want money as much as any mandarin in
China?’ He recommends the notion to his clerical friend,
who, by mending the church windows, might increase his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>income, and his popularity in the parish into the bargain.
How acceptable must these jocose passages in his letters
have been to those who loved him, after the terrible period of
gloomy hallucinations; but a bright vein of humour was
generally interwoven with the darkest threads of Cowper’s
life. He had always evinced a passion for animals, and had a
fancy for pets; and besides the hares (whose lives and deaths,
if we may be permitted a Hibernianism, he has rendered
immortal), Cowper was the proprietor of a flock of pigeons,
which perched every morning on the garden wall, awaiting
the moment when their gentle master should appear to give
them breakfast. Still writing to Unwin, he says: ‘If your wish
should ever be fulfilled, and you obtain the wings of a dove, I
shall assuredly find you some fine morning among my flock; but,
in that case, pray announce yourself, as I am convinced your
crop will require something better than tares to feed upon.’</p>

<p class='c035'>There is something very refreshing in his outburst of
indignation at the manner in which Dr. Johnson handles
Milton, ‘plucking the brightest feathers’ (or at least so Cowper
thought) ‘from the Muse’s wing, and trampling them under his
great foot. I should like to thrash his old jacket till his
pension jingled in his pockets.’ He gives a most amusing
description of an unwelcome visitor at Olney, in which he
carefully draws the line between a ‘travelled man’ and a
‘travelled gentleman.’ He speaks of the intruder’s long and
voluble talk, which set their favourite robins twittering
through rivalry, neither the birds nor the talker inclining
to give in; but, ‘I am thankful to say the robins survived it,
and so did we.’</p>

<p class='c035'>A delightful ray of human sunshine crossed the monotonous
path of Cowper’s life about this time, and for a period
cheered and relieved its grey and sombre colouring. Looking
out of the window one afternoon, he saw Mrs. Jones (the wife
of a neighbouring clergyman) entering the opposite shop, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>company with a being (no other word could be applicable),
whose appearance riveted him to the spot. He summoned
Mrs. Unwin to his side, and requested she would ask both
ladies to tea. The stranger proved to be Mrs. Jones’s sister,
a widow, Lady Austen by name, lately returned from a
lengthened sojourn in France, where she appeared, by all
accounts, to have become imbued with a large portion of
French vivacity, without losing any of those sterling qualities
or earnestness of purpose, for which we (at least) give our fair
countrywomen credit. The sisters accepted the invitation,
and, as they entered the room, Cowper, with his characteristic
timidity, made his escape at the other door. But
the attraction was too great; he soon stole back to the tea-table,
plunged headlong into conversation, and, when the
ladies rose to take leave, craved permission to accompany
them part of the way home. In fact, he had fallen in
(Platonic) love at first sight. Lady Austen was soon in
the receipt of poems and letters, addressed to ‘Sister Anna.’
Mrs. Jones having gone to join her husband in London, Lady
Austen, finding herself lonely, and surrounded, she said, by
burglars, was easily persuaded to settle at Olney, and at first
under the same roof as Cowper and Mrs. Unwin. It was a
large rambling house. ‘She has taken that part of the building
formerly occupied by Dick Coleman, his wife, child, and
a thousand rats.’</p>

<p class='c035'>We confess to sharing the opinion of the author of a
charming sketch of Cowper’s life, lately published, when he
says, ‘That a woman of fashion, accustomed to French <i>salons</i>,
should choose such an abode, with a couple of Puritans for
her only society, surely proves that one of the Puritans, at
least, possessed some great attraction for her.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The Vicarage was too large for the requirements of Mr.
Scott (Newton’s successor), whose sermons Lady Austen
admired, though it was said he scolded rather than preached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>the Gospel; and so it was settled she should take rooms in
his house, and the door of communication between the Scott
and Cowper gardens was opened. Cowper writes to Unwin
on the subject of the charming widow, and expatiates on the
delightful change wrought in their daily life by her advent.
‘Our society,’ he says, ‘is not much increased, but the presence
of one individual has made the whole difference. Lady Austen
and we pass the day alternately at each other’s château. In
the morning I walk with one or other of the ladies; in the
evening I wind thread;—so did Hercules, and so, I opine, did
Samson! Were either of these heroes living, I should not
fear challenging them to a trial of skill.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Austen became as watchful as his older associate in
marking the different phases of Cowper’s moods, and as
assiduous in her endeavours to cheer and amuse him. She
would sit by his side for hours, and tax her memory for
anecdotes of foreign life, and the chequered scenes through
which she had passed; and while Mrs. Unwin set him to work
on moral satires, on ‘The Progress of Error,’ ‘Table-Talk,’
and, if we may so express it, sermons in verse, his younger
companion suggested more lively themes for his Muse. One
eventful evening, bent on cheering the drooping spirits of the
invalid, Lady Austen related to him the wonderful adventures
of John Gilpin. The poet laughed, laughed immoderately,
went to bed, woke in the night and laughed again and again;
and the next morning at breakfast he produced the immortal
poem. How many generations, how many children of all
ages have laughed since! how many artists have striven to
portray their conception of that famous ride, till it was
reserved for the pencil of Caldecott to embody (who can
doubt it?) the very ideal of the poet’s fancy! Gilpin became
widely known, even while the author continued unknown.
Henderson, the popular actor, recited the ballad on the stage,
and far and near it was read and re-read with delight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Cowper now frequently turned to Lady Austen for subjects, and
followed her injunctions to the letter when she playfully bade
him ‘sing the sofa,’ on which she sat. This poem swelled
into ‘The Task’ and ‘The Task’ it was that made Cowper
famous. There is no doubt that the first stone of his future
fame was laid by the fair hand of that friend from whom he was
so soon to be separated. ‘The Task,’ while inculcating piety
and morality (the absence of which ingredients would have
been impossible in any of Cowper’s lengthened writings),
abounded in exquisite descriptions of life at home and
abroad, paintings of Nature, of the quiet, homely, lovely,
loveable nature of his own native land, some passages of
which can scarcely be surpassed for calm beauty and musical
rhythm. Let those readers unacquainted with ‘The Task’ turn
to the lines where the poet stands, with the friend ‘whose arm
has been close locked in his for twenty years,’ on the
eminence, when their ‘pace had slackened to a pause,’ and
judge for themselves of Cowper’s talents as a landscape
painter. His interiors are as perfect in their way. How
irresistible is the invitation to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Stir the fire, and close the shutters fast,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Let fall the curtains, draw the sofa round’!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c036'>We feel, as we read, a glow of comfort and snugness, and
would gladly make a fourth beside the table, on which stand
the cups that cheer without inebriating.</p>
<p class='c035'>The success of ‘The Task’ was immediate and complete;
the author suddenly found himself famous and popular. The
postmaster at the little office at Olney had double work:
acquaintances who had neglected him for years now boasted
of their intimacy with the lion of the day; visitors arrived at
Olney to stare at him; anonymous letters and presents poured
in on all sides. An amusing incident occurred one day, when
the clerk of All Saints’ Church, Northampton, was ushered into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Cowper’s presence. He had come, he said, with a petition to
the new poet: Would he consent to contribute the mortuary
verses, annually appended to the bills of mortality, in the
capital of England’s most midland county?</p>

<p class='c035'>Cowper advised the messenger to apply to Mr. Cox, a
statuary in the town, who wrote verses. ‘Alas!’ replied the
clerk, ‘I have already got help from him; but he is a gentleman
of so much reading that our townspeople cannot understand
him.’ The very doubtful compliment thus implied
amused our poet into compliance, and he became a contributor
to the lugubrious periodical.</p>

<p class='c035'>It was characteristic of William Cowper that, a few years
later, he forbade Lady Hesketh to apply in his behalf for the
office of Poet-Laureate to the Court, yet he willingly accepted
the office thus proposed to him by the clerk of Northampton!</p>

<p class='c035'>We are now approaching one of the many sad episodes in
Cowper’s sad life; we allude to his estrangement from Lady
Austen,—she who had been for some time a vision of delight
to his eye, and heart. Not long before he had written some
most unprophetic lines to his ‘dear Anna.’ We do not quote
them from any admiration for the verses, but because they
bear painfully on the subject:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Mysterious are His ways, whose power</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Brings forth that unexpected hour,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When minds that never met before</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Shall meet, unite, and part no more.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c036'>Further on, after describing the suddenness of their friendship,
he says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And placed it in our power to prove,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>By long fidelity and love,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That Solomon has wisely spoken,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A <i>threefold cord</i> cannot be broken!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c036'>It appears that even the wisdom of Solomon is sometimes
at fault, for it was but a few weeks after that the threefold cord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>was rudely snapped asunder. ‘I enclose,’ writes Cowper to
Mr. Unwin, ‘a letter from Lady Austen, which pray return.
We are reconciled. She seized the first opportunity to
embrace your mother, with tears of the tenderest affection,
and I, of course, am satisfied.’</p>
<p class='c035'>Lady Austen went away for a time; and later on, Cowper
again writes to Unwin, under the seal of profound secrecy:
‘When persons for whom I have felt a friendship disappoint
and mortify me, by their conduct, or act unjustly by me,
although I no longer esteem them, I feel that tenderness for
their character that I would conceal the blemish if I could.’
Then, naming the lady to whom he alluded, he goes on:
‘Nothing could be more promising, however sudden in its
commencement, than our friendship. She treated us with as
much unreserve as if we had been brought up together. At
her departure she proposed a correspondence with me, as
writing does not agree with your mother.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He then proceeds to tell how, after a short time, he perceived,
by the tenor of Lady Austen’s letters that he had
unintentionally offended her, and, having apologised, the
wound seemed healed; but finding, on repeated occasions,
that she expressed ‘a romantic idea of our merits, and built
such expectations of felicity on our friendship, as we were
sure that nothing human could possibly answer, I wrote to
remind her that we were mortal, and to recommend her not
to think too highly of us, intimating that, when we embellish
a creature with colours taken from our own fancy, and extol
it above its merits, we make it an idol,’ etc.</p>

<p class='c035'>The reader, even if he be no poet, can supply the rest of
this homily; and if he be of our way of thinking, he will smile
at the frequent use of the plural pronoun. Neither will he
be surprised to hear that the letter in question ‘gave mortal
offence,’ even though the writer had read it aloud, before
posting it, ‘to Mrs. Unwin, who had honoured it with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>warmest approbation.’ We still quote the correspondence
with William Unwin. ‘If you go to Bristol, you may possibly
fall in with a lady who <i>was</i> here very lately. If you should
meet, remember that we found the connection on some
accounts an inconvenient one, and we do not wish to renew
it; so pray conduct yourself accordingly. A character with
which we spend all our time should be made on purpose for
us, and in this case the dissimilitude was felt continually, and
consequently made our intercourse unpleasant.’ Now the
strain of this letter helps us to understand that the one
written not long before to Lady Austen was no sooner read
than she flung it indignantly into the fire.</p>

<p class='c035'>But so it was, and, for our part, we are loath to see the
bright vision, which had cast a halo over dull little Olney,
vanish from the horizon. Cowper’s biographers are all at
issue as to the cause of this estrangement, ‘it is so difficult to
solve the mystery.’ To us the only difficulty appears in the
choice of solutions. Hayley, who handles the matter with
delicacy and discretion, says, ‘Those acquainted with the
poet’s <i>innocence and sportive piety</i> would agree that the verses
inscribed to Anna might assuredly have been inspired by a
real sister.’ To him they appeared ‘the <i>effusions of a gay and
tender gallantry</i>, quite distinct from any amorous attachment.’
At the same time, he sees the possibility of a lady, only called
by that endearing name, mistaking all the attentions lavished
upon her, as ‘a mere prelude to a closer alliance.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The good-hearted, high-flown Hayley concludes by expressing
his sympathy with Cowper, as being ‘perplexed by <i>an
abundance of affection in a female associate</i>‘—surely he should
have said a couple!</p>

<p class='c035'>The Rev. Mr. Scott, for some time Lady Austen’s landlord
at Olney, is reported to have said: ‘Who can wonder that
two women, who were continually in the society of one
man, should quarrel, sooner or later?’</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Southey (an evident partisan of Mrs. Unwin’s), while
acquitting Lady Austen of any ‘matrimonial designs,’ urges
that it would be impossible for a woman of threescore to feel
any jealousy in the matter of Cowper’s affections. Now it
strikes us that the woman of threescore could herself have
had no ‘matrimonial intentions,’ or she would have carried
them out long before. But is it likely that Cowper’s ‘Mary’
would have tolerated a wife under the same roof, or tamely
given the <i>pas</i> to an ‘Anna’? Cowper indeed called Mrs.
Unwin his mother, and Lady Austen his sister; but the former
lady may have distrusted the ambiguity of the latter elective
relationship, knowing how frequently the appellation of brother
and sister has been used as a refuge from the impending
danger, of a nearer tie.</p>

<p class='c035'>Southey goes on to observe, in contradistinction, we suppose,
to Mr. Scott’s remark, that two women were shortly
afterwards living constantly in the society of the identical
man, without one shade of jealousy. Now Lady Austen and
Lady Hesketh differed in all respects—in age, in character, in
discipline of mind. The former had been Cowper’s early
friend, and the <i>confidante</i> of his love for her sister Theodora;
they had corresponded with each other for years; and in
one of his letters he says: ‘It seems wonderful, that, loving
you as much as I do, I should never have fallen in love with
you. I am so glad I never did, for it would have been most
inconvenient,’ etc.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Hesketh now returned from a lengthened residence
on the Continent, her husband was dead, and the intercourse
of old days was renewed, in all its happy freedom, between
the cousins. A few more words respecting poor Lady Austen,
and then her name shall be heard no more. Cowper writes
to Lady Hesketh a long letter on the subject, in which he
describes the rise, decline, and fall of the friendship, and
goes on in this strain: ‘At first I used to pay my <i>devoirs</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>to her ladyship every morning at eleven. Custom soon
became law. When I began “The Task,” I felt the inconvenience
of this daily attendance; long usage had made
that which was at first optional, a point of good manners. I
was compelled to neglect “The Task,” for the Muse that had
inspired it.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Hayley speaks in most flattering terms of Lady Austen,
in his Life of Cowper, and wrote one of the long-winded
epitaphs of the day on her death, which took place before he
had completed the poet’s biography, in the compilation of
which she had given him much assistance. After her
estrangement from the Olney household, Lady Austen
married a Frenchman, one Monsieur de Tardif, who wrote
verses to her in his own language; she accompanied her
husband to Paris in 1802, where she died.</p>

<p class='c035'>As regards Cowper, one thing is certain: he did not subscribe
to the common error, that ‘two is company, and three
none,’ but rather to the German proverb, ‘Alle gute ding, sind
drey;’ for he now summons Lady Hesketh to his side. He
entreats her to come and reside under his roof, painting, in
the most glowing colours, the happiness that her society will
afford them. He addresses her in the most tender, the
most affectionate terms—‘Dearly beloved cousin,’ ‘Dearest,
dearest,’—and often in the middle of his epistles he breaks
forth again into similar endearing epithets. Southey assures
us that Mrs. Unwin never felt a shade of jealousy for Lady
Hesketh; but no one tells us if such letters as these were
read aloud to Mary, or ‘honoured by her warmest approbation.
Among the anonymous presents which Cowper was
now in the habit of receiving, was one more acceptable than
all others, and that not only because it enclosed a cheque for
fifty pounds, with a promise that the donation should be
annual, as he writes to Lady Hesketh (whom he appoints his
‘Thanks Receiver-General,’ ‘seeing it is so painful to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>no one to thank’), but because the letter was accompanied
by ‘the most elegant gift, and the most elegant compliment,
that ever poet was honoured with,’—a beautiful tortoise-shell
snuff-box, with a miniature on the lid, representing a landscape,
with the three hares frolicking in the foreground;
above and below two inscriptions, ‘Bess, Puss, Tiny,’ and
‘The Peasant’s Nest.’ Southey had no doubt (neither would
it appear had Cowper himself, though he thinks it dishonourable
to pry into the incognito) that ‘Anonymous’ and
Theodora were synonymous. He was now hard at work
translating Homer, and he longed to read what he had done
to Lady Hesketh, as well as to Mrs. Unwin. ‘The latter,’
he says, ‘has hitherto been my touchstone, and I have never
printed a line without reference to her. With one of you
at each elbow, I shall be the happiest of poets.’</p>

<p class='c035'>To the same: ‘I am impatient to tell you how impatient
I am to see you. But you must not come till the fine
weather, when the greenhouse, the only pleasant room in the
house, will be ready to receive us, for when the plants go out,
we go in. There you shall sit, my dear, with a bed of
mignionette by your side, and a hedge of roses, honeysuckle,
and jasmine, and I will make you a bouquet of myrtle every
day. Come, come then, my beloved cousin, for I am resolved,
whatever king may reign, you shall be vicar of Olney.’ He
hopes their friendship will be perpetuated for ever; ‘For I
should not love you half so well if I did not believe you
would be my friend to all eternity. There is not room for
friendship to unfold itself in full bloom, in such a nook of
life as this; therefore I am, and must, and always will be
yours for ever.—<span class='sc'>W. Cowper.</span>’</p>

<p class='c035'>In another letter he prepares her for the aspect of his
peculiar abode: ‘The entrance hall: opposite you, stands a
cupboard, once a dove-cot, and a paralytic table, both the
work of the same author. Then you come to the parlour door,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>which we will open, and I will present you to Mrs. Unwin;
and we shall be as happy as the day is long.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Hesketh preferred separate lodgings, and, following
in the footsteps of Lady Austen, became a tenant of the
Vicarage, and inhabited the rooms so lately vacated by her
predecessor. ‘All is settled, dear cousin, and now I only
wish for June; and June, believe me, was never so much
wished for, since it was first made. To meet again, after so
long a separation, will be like a resurrection; but there is no
one in the other world whose reappearance would cause me
so much pleasure.’ He prepares her for the possible recurrence
of his fits of dejection, but is sure he will be cheerful
when she comes. In a letter to Unwin, speaking of the long-looked-for
arrival, he says: ‘I have always loved the sound
of church bells; but none ever seemed to me so musical, as
those which rang my sweet cousin into her new habitation.’
Lady Hesketh, writing a description of Mrs. Unwin, says she
‘is a very remarkable woman. She is far from being always
grave; on the contrary, she laughs <i>de bon cœur</i> on the
smallest provocation. When she speaks on grave subjects, it
is in a Puritanical tone, and she makes use of Puritanical
expressions; but otherwise she has a fund of gaiety; indeed,
but for that, she could not have gone through all she has
done. I do not like to say she idolises William, for she
would disapprove of the word; but she certainly has no will
but his. It is wonderful to think how she has supported the
constant attendance and responsibility for so many years.’
She goes on to describe the calm, quiet, dignified old lady,
sitting knitting stockings for her poet, beside his chair, with
‘the finest needles imaginable.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Cowper used to work in a little summer-house (which is
still standing, or was a few years since) of his own construction,
where there were two chairs indeed, but Lady Hesketh
did not often intrude. He says of himself about this time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>that he was happier than he had been for years. But there
are some excellent people in the world, who consider peace
unwholesome, and like to throw stones into their neighbours’
lakes, as schoolboys do, for the pleasure of ruffling the
surface. Cowper writes to William Unwin: ‘Your mother
has received a letter from Mr. Newton, which she has not
answered, and is not likely to answer. It gave us both much
concern; but it vexed her more than me, because I am so
much occupied with my work that I have less leisure to
browse on the wormwood. It contains an implied accusation,
that she and I have deviated into forbidden paths, and lead
a life unbecoming the Gospel; that many of our friends
in London are grieved; that many of our poor neighbours are
shocked; in short, I converse with people of the world, and
take pleasure therein. Mr. Newton reminds us that there is
still intercourse between Olney and London, implying that he
hears of our doings. We do not doubt it; there never was
a lie hatched in Olney that waited long for a bearer. We do
not wonder at the lies; we only wonder he believes them.
That your mother should be suspected (and by Mr. Newton,
of all people) of irregularities is indeed wonderful.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The extent of their crimes, the head and front of their
offending, were drives with Lady Hesketh in her carriage,
and visits to the Throckmortons. We suspect that was an
unpardonable offence (on account of their being Roman
Catholics) in Mr. Newton’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘Sometimes, not often, we go as far as Gayhurst, or to the
turnpike and back; we have been known to reach as far as
the cabinetmaker’s at Newport!’ And, O crowning horror!
Cowper confesses to having once or twice taken a Sunday
walk in the fields with his cousin, for Mrs. Unwin had never
been led so far into temptation. Speaking of Lady Hesketh,
who came in for her share of censure, he says: ‘Her only crime
in Olney has been to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>nurse the sick.’ The letters to Mr. Newton were in the same
strain, but modified in their expressions; for it was evident
Cowper feared his spiritual adviser, and, like some of our
Roman Catholic friends, subscribed to the infallibility of his
Pope, even while harbouring some secret misgivings on the
subject. He ventures to observe: ‘As to the opinion of our
poorer neighbours, uneducated people are seldom well
employed when judging one another, but when they undertake
to scan the motives, and estimate the behaviour, of those
whom Providence has placed a little above them, they are
utterly out of their depth.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Gentle-hearted, generous-hearted Cowper; he not only
forgave, but continued his friendship and intercourse with
his severe censor. Mr. and Mrs. Newton were his guests
after he had left Olney, and was settled in his new house; and
though the correspondence between the two men slackened
in some measure, and lost some of its unreserved character,
it was not discontinued. Neither did the poet refer to the
difference which had arisen, unless we accept such a passage
as this, as an allusion to Mr. Newton’s censoriousness.
Speaking of the narrow escape which Mrs. Unwin had run of
being burned to death, he says: ‘Had I been bereft of her, I
should have had nothing left to lean on, for all my other
spiritual props have long since broken down under me.’ It
did indeed seem strange and cruel, that the only hand found
to throw a stone at the marble shrine of Cowper, and his
Mary, should be that of his own familiar friend.</p>

<p class='c035'>When Lady Hesketh came to investigate the resources of
Olney, she decided in her own mind that it was a most unfit
place for her cousin to inhabit,—cold, damp, and dreary; and
she was not long in arranging that her two friends should change
their abode for a pretty little house called Weston, belonging to
Sir John Throckmorton, and standing in a picturesque neighbourhood
on the skirts of his park. Lady Hesketh took all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>the trouble and expense of the removal on herself; furnished
and embellished the little house; and on the day she left
Olney for London, Cowper and Mrs. Unwin drove over to
settle at Weston. But they had not been there above a
fortnight, before a sad blow fell upon them both. News came
that William Unwin was no more,—‘the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow;’ the dearly loved friend and
constant correspondent of Cowper. William Unwin was
travelling with a friend, whom he nursed to recovery through a
dangerous attack of typhus; but, catching the disease himself,
he died in the hotel at Winchester. The mother bore her
irreparable loss, ‘with her accustomed submission to the
Divine will.’ Cowper dared not give way to emotion, but the
shock was none the less severe. His letters began to show
signs of returning illness and dejection; he marks down for
his intimate friends all the variations of the mental barometer.
Alas! the storm signal was already hoisted, and the tempest
was at hand. He complained of sleeplessness: ‘It is impossible,
dear cousin,’ he writes, after explaining how heavily the
task of translation (he was busy on Homer) weighed on his
mind, ‘for a man who cannot sleep, to fight Homer’s battles.’
Religious despondency once more took possession of his
distracted mind. Speaking of a visit to his old home at
Olney, he says: ‘Dreary, dark, cold, empty—it seemed a fit
emblem of a God-forgotten, God-forsaken creature.’ Insanity
returned in all its distressing symptoms; he again attempted
self-destruction. Poor Mrs. Unwin came into the room one
day, just in time to cut him down. He would scarcely let
her out of his sight for a moment, and would allow no other
person to enter his presence.</p>

<p class='c035'>It is not our intention to dwell longer than necessary on
these dark passages in the sufferer’s life; suffice it to say, that,
as on a former occasion, the cure was instantaneous; and, after
an interval of several months, he once more took up the thread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>of his work and correspondence. He tells Lady Hesketh he is
mending in health and spirits, speaks enthusiastically of the
Throckmortons’ kindness, and says that he has promised them
she will soon be at Weston. ‘Come then; thou art always welcome;
all that is here is thine, together with the hearts of those
who dwell here.’ Alluding to her father’s declining health, he
‘is happy not to have grown old before his time. Trouble and
anguish do that for some, which longevity alone does for others.
A few months ago I was older than he is now; and though I
have lately recovered, as Falstaff says, “some snatch of my
youth,” I have but little confidence, and expect, when I least
expect it, to wither again.’ In the midst of some melancholy
reflections he breaks out with: ‘Oh how I wish you could see
the gambols of my kitten! They are indescribable; but time,
that spoils all, will, I fear, sooner or later, make a cat of her.’
Then he relates, for his cousin’s amusement, how a lady in
Hampshire had invited him to her house, bribing him with
the promise of erecting a temple in her grounds ‘to the best
man in the world.’ Not only that, but, would she believe it,
a Welsh attorney has sent him his verses to revise and criticise!
a lady had stolen his poem of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A rose had been washed, just washed by a shower,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Which Mary (Mrs. Unwin) to Anna (Lady Austen) conveyed.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c036'>‘You must excuse it, if you find me a little vain, for the poet
whose works are stolen, and who can charm an attorney, and
a Welsh one into the bargain, must be an Orpheus, if not
something greater.’ He was at work again on Homer, and,
when urged not to overtax his mind in so doing, says he considers
employment essential to his wellbeing. But writing was
irksome to him, and he found innumerable volunteers for the
office of secretary,—Lady Hesketh, Mrs. Throckmorton,
young Mr. Rose—a new but true friend,—and his favourite
kinsman John, or Johnny, Johnson, of Norfolk.</p>
<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Cowper and Mrs. Unwin had a succession of guests at The
Hermitage, as he sometimes called Weston; among others,
Mr. Rose, an agreeable young man, a great admirer of the
poet’s, who writes his sister an account of their life, and speaks
of Lady Hesketh, ‘A pleasant and agreeable woman, polite
without ceremony;’ of Mrs. Unwin, ‘A kind angel;’ of their
amusing breakfasts, ‘which take an hour or more, to satisfy
the sentiment, not the appetite, for we talk, O heavens! how
we talk!’</p>

<p class='c035'>Cowper was much attached to Rose. Speaking of his
departure: ‘When a friend leaves me, I always feel at my
heart a possibility that perhaps we have met for the last
time, and that before the return of summer, robins may be
whistling over the grave of one of us.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Our poet was very fond of mere rhyming, and did not
despise doggerel, for we can call the Lines to his ‘dearest Coz,’
after the manner of Shenstone, by no other name,—being an
inventory of all his goods and chattels, including the cap, so
thoroughly identified with his image in our minds. It was
the fashion of the day, more especially for literary men, to lay
aside the heavy periwig, and don this most unbecoming but,
we imagine, more comfortable head-gear.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The cap which so stately appears,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With ribbon-bound tassel, on high,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c036'>was the gift of his Harriet, and so were the bookshelves, the
chairs, tables,—all enumerated in verse—‘endearing his
abode,’ by recalling the memory of her, from whom he daily
expects a visit, only she is in attendance on</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The oldest and dearest of friends,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Whose dial-plate points to eleven,...</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And who waits but a passage to heaven.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c036'>And the hour struck very shortly after, for Lady Hesketh’s
father, Ashley Cowper.</p>
<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>In the sylvan glades of Yardley Chase, rich in fine old
timber, stood an ancient oak, the frequent goal of the poet’s
rambles, to which he wrote an address. The tree still bears his
name, and ‘Cowper’s Oak’ is the meeting-place of two packs
of hounds. Many a bright morning since our poet’s time have
the woods of old Yardley echoed to the sound of the huntsman’s
horn and the baying of the deep-mouthed ‘beauties.’</p>

<p class='c035'>One of his letters contains a most graphic description of
how he and Mrs. Unwin, returning from a ramble, fell in with
the hounds, and, climbing the broad stump of an elm in order
to have a better view of the proceedings, were actually in ‘at
the death.’ It is delightful to think of the poet and his Mary
in such unexpected circumstances, for they seem both to have
been much excited. ‘And thus, dear cousin,’ as Virgil says,
‘what none of the gods would have ventured to promise me,
time, of its own accord, has presented me with.’</p>

<p class='c035'>A letter to his friend Mr. Hill proves how much pleasure
a visit from the Dowager Lady Spencer had afforded him.
This remarkable woman, the daughter of Stephen Poyntz, a
distinguished diplomate, was the widow of the first Earl
Spencer, and mother of the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire.
She had made a long <i>détour</i> to call on the poet, whose works
she much admired. And he says: ‘She is one of the first
women in the world; I mean in point of character and
accomplishments. If my translation prove successful, I may
perhaps receive some honours hereafter, but none I shall
esteem more highly than her approbation. She is indeed
worthy to whom I should dedicate, and may my <i>Odyssey</i> prove
as worthy of her.’</p>

<p class='c035'>At length the happy hour arrived: Homer was translated
and ready for the press. The <i>Iliad</i> was dedicated to his
young relative, Earl Cowper, and the <i>Odyssey</i> to the Dowager
Countess Spencer.</p>

<p class='c035'>He expressed himself well satisfied with his publisher,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Johnson. ‘I verily believe that, though a bookseller, he has
the soul of a gentleman! Such strange combinations sometimes
happen.’ We give an extract from a letter which he
wrote on the conclusion of his Homeric labours to his
amanuensis, Johnny Johnson: ‘Dearest Johnny: now I can
give you rest and joy,—joy of your resting from all your
labours, in my service. But I can foretell that, if you go on
serving your friends at this rate, your life will indeed be one
of labour. Yet persevere; your rest will be all the sweeter
hereafter; in the meantime I wish you (whenever you need
him) just such a friend as you have been to me.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He was very much attached to Johnny, and it was in
allusion to his young kinsman that he said: ‘I agree with
Lavater, “Looks are as legible as books, take less time to
peruse, and are less likely to deceive.”’ Johnny did the poet
a good turn, for it was he who suggested to his aunt, Mrs.
Bodham, what a welcome present it would be if she sent
Cowper his mother’s picture,—a subject to which we have
already alluded.</p>

<p class='c035'>When Homer was concluded, Mrs. Unwin was most
anxious that he should undertake some new work, which would
occupy his thoughts for some considerable time. She dreaded
the effect of idleness, or of the mere desultory composition
of occasional poems. And therefore she rejoices that he
has been prevailed upon to edit a magnificent edition of
Milton, to translate all his Latin and Italian poems, to
select the best notes of former commentators, and to add
annotations of his own. It was a wholesome task, though
occasionally, under the pressure of nervous dejection, Cowper
cavilled at what he called the ‘Miltonic trap.’ Mrs.
Unwin, who had lately become enfeebled, had had a bad fall,
but fortunately escaped with some bruises, when one day
she was seized with giddiness, and would have again fallen to
the ground, had not Cowper saved her. There could be little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>doubt the attack was of a paralytic nature, though her companion
would not allow himself to utter the fearful word. In
this hour of utmost need an invaluable friend was raised up
in the person of William Hayley, whom Southey designates as
one of the most generous of men. We will let him speak for
himself, by giving an extract of his first letter to Cowper,
enclosing some complimentary lines. ‘Although I resisted
the idea of professing my friendship and admiration, from a
fear of intrusion, I cannot resist that of disclaiming an idea
which I have heard has been imputed to me, of considering
myself your antagonist. Allow me to say, I was solicited to
write a Life of Milton before I had the least idea that you and
Mr. Fuseli were engaged on a similar project.’ He concludes
a most amiable letter to the man ‘whose poems have so often
delighted him,’ by saying, ‘If, in the course of your work, I
have any opportunity of serving and obliging you, I shall seize
it with that friendly spirit which has impelled me, both in
prose and rhyme, to assure you that I am your most cordial
admirer.’ And thus, out of what might have proved a misunderstanding,
began that intercourse which lasted Cowper’s
life, and soothed his latter days.</p>

<p class='c035'>Speaking of Hayley’s visit to Weston, he says: ‘Everybody
here has fallen in love with him—and everybody must.
We have formed a friendship which will, I hope, last for life,
and prove an edifying example to all future poets.’ Hayley,
on his part, writing to his friend Romney, the painter, describes
at length the welcome he had received at Weston, his
delight in Cowper’s society; and then as to the grand article
of females,—‘for what is a scene without a woman in it?
Here is a Muse of seventy, whom I perfectly adore; the
woman who, for so many years, has devoted her time and fortune
to the service of this tender and sublime genius. Not
many days after this letter was written, the two authors were
returning from a morning ramble, when the news met them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>that Mrs. Unwin had had a second paralytic stroke. Cowper
rushed forward into the house, and returned in such a state of
agitation as made Hayley tremble for his reason; ‘but, by the
blessing of God, I was able to quiet him in a great measure,
and from that moment he rested on my friendship, and
regards me as providentially sent to support him in a season
of deepest affliction.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Cowper will not accept his cousin’s proposal to come to
Weston; for he wishes his dear Harriet’s visits thither to be
made for pleasure. Mrs. Unwin’s health improved. ‘It is a
blessing to us both, that, poor feeble thing as she is, she has
an invincible courage. She always tells me she is better, and
probably will die saying so; and then it will be true, for then
she will be best of all.’ Hayley, before, and since leaving
Weston, had urged Cowper to pay him a visit at what his
friends called his ‘little paradise’ at Eartham, on the south
coast, as soon as Mrs. Unwin’s state would allow her to
travel. It must have seemed a tremendous undertaking for
those who had not strayed further than a thirteen miles’ drive
for upwards of thirteen years! But Cowper believed the
change of air might benefit his invalid; and that determined
him.</p>

<p class='c035'>In the interim he writes to his friend, Mr. Bull: ‘How do
you think I have been occupied the last few days? In sitting,
not on cockatrice’s eggs, but for my picture. Cousin Johnny
has an aunt who is seized with a desire to have my portrait,
and so the said Johnny has brought down an artist.’</p>

<p class='c035'>To Hayley he writes:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Abbot is painting me so true,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That, trust me, you would stare,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hardly know, at the first view,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>If I were here, or there!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>It was much to be regretted that, with no lack of kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>and judicious friends—and Hayley in particular, with his good
sense and true affection,—Cowper should have fallen about
this time under the baneful influence of a fanatic, one Teedon,
a schoolmaster, who had long been a pensioner on his and
Mrs. Unwin’s bounty, at Olney. Cowper constantly spoke of
him in his letters to William Unwin and others as foolish
Mr. Teedon’s ridiculous vanity and strange delusions, who
prided himself on the immediate answers to any prayer he
might consider it advisable to put up, as also on wonderful
spiritual and audible communications. This empty-headed
man became an object of reverence rather than contempt in
the eyes of Cowper, and of poor Mrs. Unwin herself, in her
debilitated state of health. Cowper began to believe in
Teedon, and to bend beneath his influence. Had Mr.
Newton not strained the spiritual curb too tightly, he would,
in all probability, have retained his hold over the minds
of his two friends, and not exposed them to the subjugation
of one uneducated as Samuel Teedon. But enough
of this contemptible man. The friends now began to prepare
for the great enterprise, and we are not surprised to
hear Cowper say, ‘A thousand lions, monsters, and giants, are
in the way; but I suppose they will vanish if I have the
courage to face them. Mrs. Unwin, whose weakness might
justify such fears, has none.’ A coach, with four steeds, is
ordered from London to convey them on their desperate way;
the journey is to be a species of royal progress. ‘General
Cowper, who lives at Ham—is Ham near Kingston?—is to
meet me on the road, ditto my friend Carwardine and others.
When other men leave home, they make no disturbance; when
<i>I</i> travel, houses are turned upside down, people turned out of
their beds at unearthly hours, and every imaginable trouble
given. All the counties through which <i>I</i> pass appear to be in
an uproar. What a change for a man who has seen no bustle,
and made none for twenty years together!’ He is scrupulous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>respecting the numbers that will accompany him,—‘for Johnny
of Norfolk, who is with us, would be broken-hearted if left
behind.’ It would be the same with his dog Beau, who paid
a wonderful tribute to Abbot’s portrait of his master, by going
up to it, and wagging his tail furiously; while Sam, the gardener’s
boy, made a low bow to the same effigy.</p>

<p class='c035'>The travellers reached Eartham at last, Hayley’s home,
about six miles from Chichester, and five from Arundel. ‘Here,’
writes Cowper on his arrival, ‘we are as happy as it is possible
for terrestrial good to make us.’ He looked from the library
window on a fine landscape, bounded by the sea, a deep-wooded
valley, and hills which we should call mountains
in Buckinghamshire. Hayley and Cowper were both very
busy with their several works in the morning, and Johnny, as
usual, was his cousin’s transcriber. The kind host, thinking
to do honour to his guest, invited the ex-Chancellor Thurlow
to meet his old acquaintance, but his Lordship would not
come. There were, however, pleasant visitors at Eartham,
with whom Cowper fraternised,—Charlotte Smith the novelist,
and Romney the admirable painter. ‘Hayley has given me
a picture of himself by this charming artist, who is making an
excellent portrait of me in pastel.’</p>

<p class='c035'>‘Mrs. Unwin,’ he says, ‘has benefited much by the change,
and has many young friends, who all volunteer to drag her
chair round the pretty grounds.’ In spite of all these pleasant
surroundings, the two friends became home-sick, and returned
to Weston, where they found (after the manner of less gifted
mortals) that chaos had reigned in their absence. Cowper
resumed his Miltonic labours, and began preparing Homer
for a new edition. ‘I play at push-pin with Homer every
morning before breakfast, furbishing and polishing, as Paris
did his armour.’ Speaking of his assurance in having undertaken
works of such importance, he quotes Ranger’s observation
in the <i>Suspicious Husband</i>: ‘There is a degree of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>assurance in your modest men, which we impudent fellows
never arrive at.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Poor Cowper! He was again gradually sinking back
into despondency, though he combated the advances of
the enemy as far as in him lay. ‘I am cheerful on paper
sometimes when I am actually the most dejected of creatures.
I keep melancholy out of my letters as much as
I can, that I may, if possible, by assuming a less gloomy
air, deceive myself, and improve fiction into reality.’ He
is to sit for his portrait once more to Lawrence, and he
only wishes his face were moveable, to take off and on
at pleasure, so that he might pack it in a box, and send it to
the artist. On Hayley’s second visit to Weston, he found
Cowper tolerably well in appearance. Young Mr. Rose was
there, the bearer of an invitation from Lord Spencer, who
wished Cowper to meet Gibbon. ‘We did all we could to
make him accept, urging the benefit he would derive from
such genial society, and the delight he would experience from
revelling in the treasures of the magnificent library. But our
arguments were all in vain; Cowper was unequal to the exertion.’
So Rose and Hayley were his ambassadors to Althorp,
laden with his excuses. It is our intention to dwell as briefly
as is consistent with the narrative on the sad scenes now
enacting at Weston. A fearful relapse had befallen Cowper;
Mrs. Unwin’s state bordered on imbecility; and Lady Hesketh,
who had lately taken up her abode with her two afflicted
friends, seemed powerless to cheer them, and Hayley, whom
she summoned to their aid, was shocked to find that Cowper
scarcely recognised him, and manifested no pleasure in his
society. It was with the greatest difficulty that he could now
be induced to taste food, and this system of course increased
his malady, by reducing his strength. One morning a letter
arrived from Lord Spencer, announcing that the long-looked-for
pension had at length been granted,—a circumstance which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>was a great relief to his friends, but, alas! brought no satisfaction
to the sufferer’s bewildered mind. Change of air and
scene were recommended. Lady Hesketh, whose own health
was greatly impaired, went to London, and Cowper and
Mrs. Unwin were conveyed into Norfolk under the kind charge
of ‘Johnny’ Johnson. They went first to a village called
Tuddenham, and afterwards to Mundsley, on the coast.
Johnson accompanied Cowper in all his rambles, and one
day, calling on Mrs. Bodham, their cousin, to whom we have
already alluded, Cowper saw the portrait of himself painted
by Abbot; he looked at it for some time, and then, wringing
his hands, uttered a vehement wish that he were now as
happy as when he sat for that picture.</p>

<p class='c035'>He had always been very fond of coast scenery; and in
one of his early letters to William Unwin he speaks of his
astonishment at the number of people who can look on the
sea without emotion, or, indeed, reflection of any kind. ‘In
all its various forms, it is an object of all others most calculated
to affect us with lasting impressions of that awful Power
which created and controls it. Before I gave my mind to
religion, the waves used to preach to me, and I always listened.
One of Shakespeare’s characters, Lorenzo, says: “I am never
merry when I hear sweet music.” The sight and the sound of
the ocean, produces the same effect on me that harmony did on
Jessica.’ He began to write again to Lady Hesketh, but his
letters were most gloomy, and must have been painful in the
extreme for the recipient.</p>

<p class='c035'>In the first he thus expresses himself: ‘The most forlorn
of beings, I tread the shore, under the burthen of infinite despair,
which I once trod all cheerfulness and joy.’ He fancies
the vessels he sees in the offing were coming to seize him; he
shrinks from the precipice of the cliff on which he walks,
though, perhaps, it would be better for him to be dashed to
pieces. A solitary pillar of rock seems an emblem of himself:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>‘Torn from my natural connections, I stand alone, in expectation
of the storm that shall displace me;’ and so on in the
same terrible strain. He begins to suspect his faithful friend
Johnson (whom he no longer calls ‘Johnny’) of wishing to control
him, and writes to Lady Hesketh, as if compelled to do
so by stealth: ‘Dear Weston! I shall never see Weston
again, or you either. I have been tossed like a ball to a far
country, from which there is no rebound for me.’ Johnson
now moved his patients to a new residence, Dunham Lodge,
in the neighbourhood of Swaffham, and never slackened in
his attendance on his kinsman,—reading aloud to him for hours
a series of works of fiction, on which Cowper never made any
comment, though they appeared to rivet his attention. He
tells Lady Hesketh, notwithstanding, that he loses every other
sentence, from the inevitable wanderings of his mind. ‘My
thoughts are like loose and dry sand, which slips the sooner
away the closer it is grasped.’ Cowper could not bear now to
be left alone, and if he were so for a short time, he would watch
on the hall door steps for the barking of dogs at a distance, to
announce his kinsman’s return. Mrs. Powley, Mrs. Unwin’s
daughter, came with her husband to visit her mother, and was
much touched by the affection which Cowper still manifested
for his Mary, even in moments of the deepest dejection. By
degrees he was induced to listen composedly, both to the
reading of the Bible, and also to family prayers, which at first
his companions feared might excite instead of soothing him.
Johnson laid a kind trap in order to coax the invalid into a
renewal of his literary occupations. One day he designedly mentioned
in Cowper’s hearing, that, in the new edition of Pope’s
Homer, by Wakefield, there were some passages in which the
two translations were compared. The next morning he placed
all the volumes of the work in a large unfrequented room,
through which Cowper always passed on his way from his morning
visit to Mrs. Unwin; and the next day Johnson found, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>his great satisfaction, that his kinsman had examined the books,
and made some corrections and revisions, an occupation which
Cowper continued for some little time with apparent interest.
But this improvement did not last long: the melancholy
household moved again to Mundsley, and then to Johnson’s
own home, at Dereham, which was considered less dreary than
the house of Dunham Lodge. It was there that, on the
17th of December, Mrs. Unwin, Cowper’s faithful and devoted
Mary, passed away from earth calmly and peacefully. In the
morning of that day, when the maid opened the shutters,
Cowper asked, ‘Is there still life upstairs?’ She died in the
afternoon, and he went up with Mr. Johnson to take a farewell
look; and, after silently gazing on the lifeless form for
some time, he burst into a paroxysm of tears, left the room,
‘and never,’ says Hayley, ‘spoke of her more.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Mrs. Unwin was buried by torchlight in the north aisle of
Dereham Church, where a marble tablet was placed to her
memory.</p>

<p class='c035'>After this event there was little improvement, though some
fluctuations, in Cowper’s state. His friends, Lady Spencer,
Sir John Throckmorton, and others, came to visit him, but
he showed no pleasure in seeing them. He occasionally wrote
short verses, especially Latin, suggested to him by Johnson,
made revisions and corrections, and a longer poem, embodying
the most gloomy thoughts, ‘The Castaway,’ from an incident
in one of Anson’s voyages, the last and saddest of his works.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘For misery still delights to trace</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Its semblance in another’s case.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>The end was drawing near. Lady Hesketh was too
unwell to go to him; Hayley was in attendance on his dying
son; Mr. Rose went to bid him farewell, and Cowper, who
had evinced no pleasure at his arrival, mourned his departure.</p>

<p class='c035'>Johnson thought it now incumbent on him to prepare his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>friend’s mind for the impending danger, to which Cowper listened
patiently. But when his kinsman thought to soothe
him by speaking of the blessed change from earthly sorrow to
the joys of heaven, the unhappy listener broke forth into wild
entreaties that he would desist from such topics.</p>

<p class='c035'>On the 25th of April 1800, William Cowper expired, so
quietly that not one of the five persons who stood at his bedside
was aware of the exact moment. ‘From that time till he
was hidden from our sight,’ says his faithful and untiring
watcher, Johnson, ‘his countenance was that of calmness and
composure, mingled, as it were, with <i>a holy surprise</i>,’—words
of deepest pathos, indissolubly connected with the poet’s
memory. They inspired Charles Tennyson Turner, our
Laureate’s worthy brother, with one of his most beautiful
sonnets,—‘On Cowper’s Death-smile’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That orphan smile, born since our mourner died,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A lovely prelude of immortal peace.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>Cowper lies buried in the church at Dereham, where his
cousin Harriet placed a monument to his memory.</p>

THE only daughter and youngest child of the
first Viscount Melbourne, by Elizabeth,
daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke. When
only eighteen she became the wife of Peter
Leopold, fifth Lord Cowper, in the same
year that her brother William married Lady
Caroline Ponsonby. We are confident we cannot do better
than quote some passages from an article, published on Lady
Palmerston’s death, by an eminent writer, who was her personal
friend: ‘On her marriage, Lady Cowper immediately took
her place amid that brilliant galaxy of beautiful and accomplished
women who continued to form the chief ornament of
the British Court, through successive reigns, till they were
gradually replaced (not outshone) by a younger race.’ He
goes on to describe how Lady Cowper was admired and
distinguished in the brilliant seasons of 1814 and 1815, on
the occasion of the Royal and Imperial visits to England.
While speaking of later years, after her second marriage,
he says at that time coteries, cliques, and, above all, party
exclusiveness in politics, prevailed. But at Cambridge House
there were no such limitations. All classes—political, diplomatic,
literary, scientific, artistic—found a welcome, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the proverbially dull ‘country cousin,’ who had any claim on
Lady Palmerston’s notice; they were all received with a
gracious smile and a kind word by the amiable hostess.
Her country houses bore the same character for hospitality
and variety of attraction as the London dwelling, and
foreigners, in particular, were never tired of recording the
delights of Panshanger, Brocket (to which she succeeded on
her brother’s death), and Broadlands. The same biographer
says of Lady Palmerston that she never forgot a friend,
or remembered an injury; and, speaking of her devotion to
her husband: ‘She was most jealous of his reputation, and
proud of his distinction as a Minister. Every night she sat
up for him until his return from the House of Commons,
and her many anxieties on his account were often hurtful
to her health.’ After his death, her circle was almost entirely
restricted to her own family and connections.</p>

<p class='c034'>Lady Palmerston was esteemed a most excellent ‘<i>man</i> of
business,’ managing her vast property and large households
with consummate skill. She died in her eighty-second year.</p>

<p class='c034'>London in her time was especially rich in courtly beauties,
the fame of whose charms still survives: the Duchess of
Rutland, Ladies Jersey and Tankerville, Charlotte Campbell,
and many other names, well known to those who read the
memoirs of the period. Among such formidable competitors
Lady Cowper held her own for grace and beauty, while she
far surpassed most of her contemporaries in intellectual gifts.
She was much attached to her brother, whose upward career
was a source of pride and satisfaction to her. But in early life
she evinced no personal interest in politics.</p>

<p class='c034'>Lord Cowper died in 1837; his widow married, in 1839,
Lord Palmerston, and from that moment she became immersed
in political life, watching with the keenest interest the public
events which were passing around her.</p>

<p class='c034'>Her brother, Lord Melbourne, was at this period at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>head of the Government, and ere long her husband was
destined to occupy the same position. Lady Palmerston now
formed a <i>salon</i>, which continued for the lapse of many years to
constitute one of the greatest attractions of London society.
We use the word <i>salon</i> advisedly, for these assemblies bore a
nearer resemblance, in character and quality, to the <i>salons</i> of
Paris, than most congregations of guests to be met with in a
London drawing-room.</p>

THE youngest child of William the Silent,
Prince of Orange. Born at Delft, christened
with great rejoicings, and named after his
two godfathers, the kings of Denmark and
Navarre. His mother, Louisa de Coligny,
had been early marked out for misfortune;
her father, the brave Gaspard de Chatillon, High Admiral of
France, and her first husband, the Sieur de Teligny, were
both victims of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. So sad a
fate has surely befallen few women, to see a beloved parent
and two husbands fall by the hands of cruel assassins. When
she was first left a widow, Louisa de Coligny escaped into
Switzerland, and after a time became the fourth wife of
William the Silent, Prince of Orange. During their short
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>union, she endeared herself to her husband and the whole
country by the tender care she bestowed on her step-children.
At the time of William’s murder, Frederic Henry was but
an infant. ‘I am left,’ says the unhappy widow, ‘with a six-months’
child, sole pledge of my dead lord, my only pleasure
and consolation.’</p>

<p class='c035'>A letter to England gives a most pathetic account of a visit
paid to her a short time after the Prince’s murder. ‘I found
the Princess,’ says the writer, ‘in a most dark, melancholy
little chamber; and it was a twice sorrowful sight to behold
her heaviness and apparel, augmented by the wofulness of
the place; and truly the perplexity I found her in was not
only for the consideration for things past, but for that which
might follow hereafter. The Princess de Chimay was with
her, herself a dolorous lady.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The widow’s grief had been insulted by the discourse of
an unfeeling preacher at Leyden, who, alluding to the murder
of the Prince, attributed it to the vengeance of God on the
‘French marriage,’ and the wicked pomp with which the
child’s christening had been solemnised.</p>

<p class='c035'>Motley’s portrait of Louisa deserves to be transcribed:
‘A small, well-formed woman, with delicate features, exquisite
complexion, and very beautiful dark eyes, that seemed in
after years, as they looked from beneath her coif, to be dim
with unshed tears; remarkable powers of mind, sweetness of
disposition, a winning manner, and a gentle voice.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Such a woman soon became dear to the honest Hollanders,
and was indeed a good monitress, not only to her own child,
but to Prince Maurice, who loved and honoured her, and was
inclined on most occasions to listen to her counsels.</p>

<p class='c035'>She devoted herself in the first years of her widowhood
to superintending the education of Frederic Henry or
Henry Frederic, as he is called by different historians. The
Stadtholder, Maurice, seems to have been much attached to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>his half-brother, who, while still a child, proved his apt and
willing scholar in the art of warfare. The boy stood under
fire for the first time when only thirteen, and was with the
army when the siege of Nieuport was projected. Now, this
enterprise was considered so hazardous, that Maurice determined
his brother should remain in a place of safety, on
whom, in the event of his own death, the hopes of the nation
would be centred. But this decision was most repugnant to
the brave boy’s inclinations, and he besought the General,
with clasped hands and urgent prayers, to allow him to share
in the glory and danger of the day. There was too much
sympathy between those two noble spirits that Maurice
should find it in his heart to withstand the young soldier’s
persistent supplication. He sent for a new suit of armour, in
which Frederic, bravely equipped, side by side with his young
kinsman, De Coligny, participated in the honours of that
memorable victory.</p>

<p class='c035'>In the early days of his government, Maurice had pledged
himself to his stepmother to remain unmarried, by which
means her son would succeed as Stadtholder; but it was
supposed that he went further, and whispered to her that
Frederic should inherit a kingly crown if the Princess would
assist him in obtaining the sovereignty, which he (Maurice)
so ardently desired.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1605 the young Prince was in command of a body of
veterans in an attack on the Spaniards, at Mühlheim, by the
Rhine, when Maurice, riding up on the opposite shore, perceived
with dismay that a panic had seized the usually steady
and valiant troops. He saw his brother fighting manfully in
the thickest of the fray, his gilded armour and waving orange
plumes making him the aim of every marksman. On that
occasion, at all events, Maurice did not ‘keep silence.’ He
tore up and down the bank, taunting and cursing the soldiers
who were deserting their brave young commander, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>loud and angry expostulations rallied the fugitives, and saved
his brother’s life.</p>

<p class='c035'>When the exiled King and Queen of Bohemia arrived at
the Hague, to ask shelter and protection from the House of
Orange, Elizabeth brought in her train the faithful and
favourite Amelia de Solms, a young lady whose intelligence
and beauty made a deep impression on the heart of Prince
Frederic. There is some little difficulty in reconciling the
different accounts, as the Queen speaks of the lovers’ entire
devotion; yet we are told that Maurice threatened Frederic
that, if he did not make up his mind to marry the German
lady, he would himself espouse a Mademoiselle de Merck, by
whom he had already had more than one child, who would in
that case be accepted by the law of that land as legitimate.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Queen of Bohemia, in writing to an English correspondent,
says: ‘I am sure you heere already of the Prince of
Orange’s marriage with one of my women, the daughter of
Count de Solms, who served the King in Heidelberg. She is
verie handsome and goode. She has no money, but he has
enough for both.’</p>

<p class='c035'>To return to more public matters. A short time after
Maurice’s death the stronghold of Breda was taken by
Spinola. This general had besieged the place for so long,
and had been so much disheartened by plausible reports of
the enemy’s resources, that he asked permission of the
Spanish King to raise the siege. The answer was laconic
and peremptory, ‘<i>Marquez, sumais Breda. Yo el Rei.</i>‘ There
was no questioning such a command, and Spinola prosecuted
the attack with redoubled energy. In the meantime, the
garrison was suffering from hunger and privations of all
kinds; and a mutinous spirit was spreading so fast as to
induce the brave governor, Justin of Nassau (an illegitimate
son of William the Silent), to ask the Prince to allow him
to capitulate.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Frederic replied that he considered it advisable to do so,
remarking at the same time that if Spinola did but know the
real state of the case, he would not be likely to grant very
honourable terms. This letter fell into the hands of the
enemy, but the writer misjudged his generous-hearted foe.
With the true ‘garbatezza italiana,’ Spinola (undeterred by
the indignant opposition of most of his officers) gave orders
that the Dutch troops should march out with colours flying,
drums beating, and all the honours of war. He also granted
them leave to carry away many valuables, more especially all
the personal property of the late Prince Maurice. Still
further to prove his respect for the courage displayed by the
garrison, he watched them as they sallied forth, lifting his hat
with graceful courtesy, and exchanging salutations with his
noble adversaries.</p>

<p class='c035'>When the King of Bohemia died, he recommended his
widow and children in the most urgent terms to the protection
of the States-General and the Stadtholder, to whom Elizabeth
also drew up a memorial, in which, after speaking of her profound
grief, she goes on to say: ‘My first great resource is in
Heaven; next to that Divine trust, I confide in you; nor will I
doubt that to me and my children will be continued that
friendship so long manifested to my lamented consort. It is
for you to shelter those who suffer for truth and righteousness’
sake.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The Royal petitioner was liberally dealt with, and the
generous allowance which Maurice (whom she called her
second father) had allotted her, was continued.</p>

<p class='c035'>Frederic, on succeeding to the government, had found
the country in a ferment of religious and political discord;
and he endeavoured to exercise a tranquillising influence
both at home and abroad. He would gladly have made
peace with Spain if he could have done so with honour, but
this was impossible; and he took the field fired with all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>the military ardour which had ever distinguished the House
of Orange.</p>

<p class='c035'>In his successive campaigns against the Spaniards, he
achieved, for the most part, brilliant victories, possessing himself,
one after another, of places of the greatest importance.
But although distasteful to himself and the country at large,
yet, from motives of policy, he was induced to enter into an
alliance with France, and maintained a frequent correspondence
with the Minister, Cardinal Richelieu. On the surface
of things they were friends, but Richelieu hated the Stadtholder,
and was said to have employed Frederic’s own valet
as a spy on his master’s actions. In 1637 the all-powerful
Cardinal, anxious to propitiate Holland, sent the Count de
Charnacé as ambassador to the Hague, who, in the presence
of the assembled States, addressed Frederic as ‘Prince’ and
‘Highness,’ instead of Excellency, the title he had hitherto
borne. The Stadtholder was not insensible to the distinction,
more particularly as the example set by France was followed
by all the Royal houses in Europe.</p>

<p class='c035'>He further added to the dignity and importance of his
family by uniting his son with the Princess Mary, daughter
to Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> of England, a marriage which afforded general
satisfaction. There were great festivities at the Hague
on the occasion, and we are told that ‘the Queen of
Bohemia and her fair daughters contributed not a little to
enhance the grace and beauty of the Court pageants.’ The
Dutch continued their victories both by sea and land, their
naval engagements in particular being most brilliant. Henry
Frederic’s last feat of arms was to complete the frontier line,
which his skill and valour had helped to ensure to his country;
and the Spaniards were at length compelled to acknowledge
the independence of those Provinces already united. The
Stadtholder was not permitted long to enjoy the improved
aspect of affairs. He died in March 1647, during the session
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>of the Congress of Münster, and was buried with great splendour
at the Hague. He left one son, William, and four
daughters, by Amelia de Solms, who survived him several
years, residing at the Hague, where she had built a fine palace,
and amassed a large fortune. Henry Frederic was of a noble
presence, well formed, and robust; his disposition was modest
and temperate, and his manners gracious and conciliating.
He was a scholar, as well as a soldier, and dictated to one of
his officers memoirs of his principal campaigns, which were
much esteemed. He had none of Maurice’s personal ambition,
and never aspired to the sovereignty. But ‘if it were a sin to
covet honour, he was the most offending soul alive.’ His son
succeeded him as Stadtholder, but died at the early age of
twenty-four, leaving his young widow with child, of a Prince,
afterwards William <span class='fss'>III.</span>, King of England.</p>

THE second son of William, Prince of Orange,
surnamed ‘the Silent’ by Anne of Saxony,
who was repudiated on account of her misconduct.
Maurice was born at the Castle of
Dillenbourg; his elder brother, Philip, had
been kidnapped from school, and carried to
Spain, where he became (says Motley) so completely Hispaniolised,
both in appearance and inclinations, as to lose all
feeling of patriotism. But his filial love was never eradicated,
and on one occasion, when a Spanish officer presumed to
speak slightly of his illustrious father, Philip flung the offender
headlong from the window of the palace, and killed him on
the spot. It was on the 10th of July 1584 that the hand of a
hired assassin cut short the career of one of the greatest and
best men that had ever illuminated the page of history;
Maurice was at that time pursuing his education at Leyden;
and the boy’s tutors had received strict orders not to allow
him to stray by the sea-shore, lest his brother’s fate should
befall him, as it was from that place Philip had been stolen.
William had died deeply in debt; he had spent his revenues
in the service of his beloved country, and at his death there
was no ready money for his widow (Louisa de Coligny), the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>step-children to whom she was fondly attached, or her own
infant son. The Prince’s effects were sold for the good of his
creditors,—plate, furniture, tapestries, his very clothes; but
this done, the States-General came forward liberally, and
settled a good allowance on the Princess and her charges.
For Maurice (whom they selected as his father’s successor)
they provided most generously, and, impressed by his promising
qualities, and the earnestness and decision of purpose which
he early evinced, they offered to place him at the head of the
States Council, a provisional executive board, for the government
of those Provinces comprised in the union. He was
doubtless a remarkable youth. A letter to Queen Elizabeth
extols ‘this flaxen-haired, gentle boy of seventeen years, his
towardness, good presence, courage, singular wit, and learning,’
while another account describes ‘his chiselled features, full
red lips, dark blue eyes (elsewhere they are called hazel) with
a concentration above his years.’ He was universally pronounced
to resemble his maternal grandfather, the celebrated
Maurice of Saxony, both in appearance and character, and in
nowise to favour his mother, who had been pale and deformed.
When offered the important post Maurice took two days to
consider; but he was not one to shrink from responsibility, and
his acceptance was dignified and modest. He had already
selected a device and motto, and nobly did he redeem the
pledge in its wider sense: a fallen oak, with a young sapling
springing from it, ‘Tandem fit surculus arbor.’ And verily the
twig soon became a tree, and a noble one.</p>

<p class='c035'>The country so lately, and now only partially, emancipated
from the detested yoke of Spain, looked anxiously round for
alliance with some foreign power, to assist in opposing King
Philip and his formidable generals.</p>

<p class='c035'>Negotiations were commenced, and carried on at great
length, with France, to whose king the sovereignty of the
Provinces was offered. Against this measure Maurice made a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>most spirited and eloquent appeal to the Council: he dwelt
on all the evils which would accrue from such a step, reminding
his hearers of the services which his family had rendered,
and the misfortunes they had undergone in the cause of
patriotism; furthermore, how nearly they had bestowed the
sovereignty on his late father,—beseeching them not to forget
the interests of the house of Nassau; and he concluded by
assuring them, that, young and inexperienced as he was, he
trusted that his zeal and devotion might be of some avail to
his country. His speech was much applauded for its
eloquence; but the negotiations with France were not discontinued,
although after a time they were transferred to
England. It seems certain that the youthful ruler indulged in
early hopes of securing the title of King for himself, but, in
default of this, he appears to have leaned to the notion of
the government of Elizabeth, in preference to that of any
other alien. She had always been a staunch upholder of
Protestantism, had been generous to his family in financial
matters, and had always expressed herself in friendly terms
towards the house of Orange; besides, England was a powerful
and desirable ally. Notwithstanding all these considerations,
Maurice did not, as he pithily expressed himself, ‘wish to be
strangled in the great Queen’s embrace.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Bess was a coquette in politics as well as love, and for a
time seemed inclined to listen to the overtures made her by
the States-General, but she finally refused. Desirous, however,
of exercising some influence in the country, she sent
over her prime favourite, the Earl of Leicester (with his
gallant nephew, Sir Philip Sidney), at the head of a large contingent
of British troops. He had stringent rules laid down
for his conduct, most of which he infringed. Not long after
his arrival he was inaugurated in the post of Governor-General
of the United Provinces, with supreme military command by
land and sea, and authority in matters civil and political. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>these capacities the States proffered him an oath of fidelity,
a step in which Maurice himself was reluctantly compelled to
join. Leicester’s whole conduct in the Netherlands was
actuated by overweening ambition and the basest covetousness;
while in accepting such high-sounding titles he incurred
the Queen’s anger,—‘acting in direct opposition,’ says
Motley, ‘to the commands of the most imperious woman in
the world.’</p>

<p class='c035'>A courtier at home, no way friendly to the arrogant
favourite, told Elizabeth how Leicester’s head was turned by
the honours heaped on him, and how he had sent over to
England to bid his Countess join him, with a suite, and all
appliances, in order to form a Court equal in splendour to
her own. ‘Indeed!’ was the angry reply; ‘we will teach the
upstarts that there is but one Queen, and her name is
Elizabeth; and they shall have no other Court but hers!’</p>

<p class='c035'>To return to Maurice: John Barneveldt (who had constituted
himself the youth’s political guardian), although
opposed to the idea of his elevation to a throne, stoutly
advocated his nomination to the post of Stadtholder, a
measure that was carried after a severe struggle. It was by
the side of this trusty friend that the young Prince first went
into action; but his first military achievement was planned
and carried into execution jointly with Sir Philip Sidney,
namely, the taking of Axel, an important stronghold, which
they carried without the loss of a single man in the combined
forces of the English and Dutch troops.</p>

<p class='c035'>A close friendship existed between Maurice of Nassau and
our gallant countryman, in spite of the latter’s near relationship
to the obnoxious Leicester, who had warned his nephew
to be prudent in his dealings with Maurice. ‘I find no
treachery in the young man,’ was the reply, ‘only a bold and
intelligent love of adventure.’ The two brave soldiers maintained
their brotherhood in arms, until the fatal day when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Sir Philip received his death-wound at the battle of Zutphen.
His undaunted courage and proverbial humanity gained him
the love and admiration of his allies and countrymen, and the
respect of his enemies.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1587 Leicester was recalled by the Queen, and compelled
to return to England. He was detested by the
majority of the Dutch nation, who had by this time discovered
his plots and treacherous schemes, and his departure cleared
the way for the further display of Maurice’s political and
military talents. He was nominated Governor Commander-in-chief
of five out of the seven United Provinces which
formed the Confederacy: and no one could surely have
been better fitted for such responsible posts. In the early
days of his government he was inclined to leave the reins
in the hands of Barneveldt, while he devoted himself
theoretically, as well as practically, to the study of war. His
leisure hours were passed in forming combinations and
executing manœuvres with pewter soldiers; in building up
and battering down, in storming and carrying wooden blocks
of mimic citadels; in fact, in arranging systems of attack,
pursuit, retreat, and defence on his table, all of which he
afterwards most effectually carried out on the field of actual
warfare; while for hours together he would pore over the
works of classical authors in the art of strategy.</p>

<p class='c035'>Maurice introduced the strictest discipline into the army,
but he was the friend and comrade of his soldiers, sharing
their privations, and exacting for them, from the hands of the
Government, the pay which had of late been but too irregularly
disbursed. His clemency to his prisoners formed a
brilliant contrast to the cruelties practised by most of the
Generals of his time, barring one or two occasions, when
driven to take reprisals. This he did, indeed, as a warning to
the Spaniards not to deal hardly with the Dutch who had
fallen into their hands. He was most severe on his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>soldiers for disobedience of orders; and with his own hand he
shot one of his men, who had been convicted of plundering a
peasant.</p>

<p class='c035'>The campaigns of 1590-92 against the Spanish troops
were for the most part as successful as they were brilliant,
and in 1596 an alliance, offensive and defensive, was concluded
with France and England.</p>

<p class='c035'>Maurice’s victories on the Rhine were so important as to
induce the Spanish king to offer him most flattering terms,
which were refused, and the war continued. We have neither
space nor inclination to enter on the history of Maurice’s
campaigns. How could we do so in our limited space, or
attempt the military memoirs of a general who was said to
have won three pitched battles, to have taken thirty-eight
strong towns and forty-five castles, and to cause the enemy to
raise twelve sieges—the great general of the age, ‘the chief
captain of Christendom,’ as Queen Elizabeth called him—the
rival in arms of the formidable Spinola?</p>

<p class='c035'>Yet we cannot resist the temptation of alluding to one or
two passages in his military life which have a picturesque or
characteristic side to the occurrence.</p>

<p class='c035'>The taking of Zutphen was one of those ingenious <i>ruses
de guerre</i> in which Maurice delighted. One bright morning
five or six peasants, with their wives, made their appearance
under the walls of the town, laden with baskets of provisions,—no
uncommon, yet a tempting sight. They sat down on
the grass, and had not long to wait before several soldiers of
the garrison came out, and began bartering for the contents of
the said baskets. Suddenly a woman drew a pistol from under
her petticoat, and shot the man dead who was haggling over
the price of her eggs.</p>

<p class='c035'>In a moment, the peasants, transformed into soldiers,
sprang on the guard, overpowered, bound them, and took
possession of the gate; while a large body of men, who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>lying in ambush, rushed to their assistance, and, following up
the advantage, carried the place without the loss of a single
man on their side.</p>

<p class='c035'>Maurice of Orange, unlike the first Napoleon, was a great
economiser of life, although so unchary of his own, that he
was reprimanded in his youth by the States for rashly exposing
himself to danger.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Spaniards thought to depreciate his strategical talents
by saying, ‘Qu’il ne sçavoit, que le méstier des taupes, de
se tapir en terre;’ but he was as successful in open warfare
as he was ingenious in stratagem. The taking of Nieuport,
which for some time seemed a forlorn hope, was one of his
most memorable victories. It resulted in the precipitate
flight of the Archduke Albert (the governor of that portion of
the Netherlands still under Spanish rule), and the entire rout
of his army; and this at the very moment that the Infanta
Isabella (Albert’s wife), reckoning without her host, was
expecting to see the Prince of Orange brought into her
presence—a prisoner. More than once during the battle the
fortunes of the patriots seemed to tremble in the balance; but
Maurice’s calmness never forsook him, and his devoted
soldiery emulated their General in courage and determination.
When assured that the day was gained, the hero, who had been
unmoved in danger, was overcome by emotion. He leaped
from his saddle, and, kneeling in the sand, raised his streaming
eyes to heaven, exclaiming, ‘O God, what are we human
creatures, to whom Thou hast brought such honour, and
vouchsafed such a victory?’</p>

<p class='c035'>So total was the discomfiture of the Spaniards, so hasty their
retreat, that they left a precious booty for the Dutch, in the
shape of ammunition, treasure, and baggage. Amongst other
personal property of the Archduke, his favourite charger fell to
the share of an officer in the Stadtholder’s army, who had often
heard the Prince express great admiration for the horse in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>question. He therefore lost no time in presenting his prize to
the General. Now, in the possession of Lord Powerscourt,
there is an exquisitely finished cabinet portrait of the great
captain, in gorgeous armour, mounted on a milk-white barb,
with a wondrous luxuriance of mane and tail, which nearly
sweep the ground. We often hear of a horse who seems to
take pride in carrying his master; but here the case is obviously
reversed. The rider is proud of his horse. The Prince
evinces an undoubted pride in the milk-white steed he mounts,
and he called upon his favourite painter, Miereveldt, to immortalise
his treasure. With such strong circumstantial evidence,
we may surely take it for granted that Lord Powerscourt’s gem
illustrates our anecdote of the victory of Nieuport.</p>

<p class='c035'>One more example of our hero’s strategical powers, and
we have done. The taking of Breda was so ingeniously conceived,
so bravely executed, that we cannot pass it over in
silence. The grand and strongly fortified castle which dominated
the town of Breda had once been the residence of the
Nassau family, and was indeed, by law, the property of Prince
Maurice. It was in the hands of the enemy, garrisoned by a
large band of Italian soldiers, under the command of the Duke
of Parma, who was however absent at the time of which we are
speaking, the Duke having left a young compatriot in command,
Lanza Vecchia by name. One night, when quartered at
the Castle of Voorn, in Zeeland, Maurice received a mysterious
nocturnal visit from a certain boatman called Adrian, who had
once been a servant in the Nassau family, and was now
employed in carrying turf for fuel into the Castle of Breda.
Adrian offered his boat and his services to the Prince, assuring
him that the little vessel could enter the water-gate without
suspicion. The notion was after Maurice’s own heart. He
took counsel with Barneveldt, and it was arranged that the
boatman should be at a certain ferry the next night at twelve
o’clock. The carrying out of this daring scheme was, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Barneveldt’s advice, intrusted to one Heraugière, a man of
undoubted valour, who having fallen into temporary disgrace,
would be most willing (urged his advocate) to redeem his
character with the General. Sixty-eight men were selected
from different regiments, with three officers as his comrades in
the hazardous enterprise, who all proceeded to the rendezvous
at the appointed hour. Adrian himself did not appear. His
heart failed him, and he sent two nephews in his stead, whom
he designated as ‘dare-devils.’ It was certainly no undertaking
for faint hearts to embark in. The devoted little band
went on board the boat, and stowed themselves away as best
they might under the piles of turf with which the bark was
ostensibly laden. Everything seemed leagued against them:
fog, sleet, large blocks of ice, impeded their progress, while
the weather proved most tempestuous, and the wind contrary.</p>

<p class='c035'>From Monday night till Thursday morning seventy men
lay huddled together almost suffocated, enduring hunger,
thirst, and intense cold without a murmur, without regret at
having undertaken so perilous a duty. At one time they were
compelled to creep out and steal to a neighbouring castle, in
order to procure some refreshment, and it was not till Saturday
morning that they entered the last sluice, and all possibility of
retreat was at an end,—that handful of men, half frozen with
cold, half crippled by confinement to so small a space, to cope
with a whole garrison of vigorous and well-fed soldiers! An
officer came on board to inspect the fuel, of which he said
they stood sorely in need, and went into the little cabin, where
the hidden men could see him plainly, and hear every word
he uttered. No sooner had he gone on shore than the keel
struck against some obstruction. The vessel sprang a leak,
and began to fill.</p>

<p class='c035'>All was surely now lost, and the men who came to unload
the boat made her safe, close under the guard-house, and
proceeded with their work. To add to the soldiers’ danger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>the damp and cold had brought on fits of sneezing and
coughing, which it was most difficult to resist. One of these
gallant men, who well deserved his name of ‘Held,’<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c050'><sup>[2]</sup></a> feeling
his cough impossible to control, drew his dagger and besought
the soldier next him to stab him to the heart, lest he should
cause the failure of the enterprise and the destruction of his
comrades. But thanks to the ingenuity of the skipper, this noble
fellow lived to glory in the success of the undertaking, and his
name still lives in the hearts and memory of his countrymen.
The dare-devil came to the rescue; he set the pumps going,
which deadened every other sound, and there he stood, worthy
of the sobriquet his uncle had given him, exchanging jokes
with the labourers and the purchasers, and at length dismissing
them all with a few stivers for ‘drink-geld,’ saying it was much
too late to unload any more turf that night.</p>

<div class='footnote c052' id='f2'>
<p class='c034'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hero.</p>
</div>

<p class='c035'>So they all departed, excepting the servant of the captain
of the guard, who was most difficult to get rid of, chattering
and gossiping, and complaining of delay.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘Be content,’ said the skipper, one of those men who
must have his joke, even in moments when life and death are
at stake; ‘the best part of the cargo is at the bottom, and it
is reserved for your master. He is sure to get enough of it
to-morrow.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The dare-devil’s words were verified to the letter; a little
before midnight the Dutch entered the town, killed every man
in the guard-room, and took possession of the arsenal. The
garrison fled in all directions, and the burghers followed their
example, young Lanza Vecchia, although himself wounded,
striving in vain to rally his men.</p>

<p class='c035'>Count Hohenloe, brother-in-law to Maurice, was the first
to enter the town at the head of large reinforcements, shortly
followed by the Prince himself. The despatch sent to
Barneveldt was as follows: ‘The castle and town of Breda
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>are ours. We have not lost a single man. The garrison made
no resistance, but fled distracted out of the town.’</p>

<p class='c035'>How reluctantly we turn the page whereon Maurice’s
golden deeds are inscribed, and come to a new episode in his
life, on which a dark shadow rests! Little by little the differences
of opinion which had long existed between the
Stadtholder and the Advocate Barneveldt ripened into open
enmity. The latter was at the head of the peace party, while
Maurice declared for continuous warfare, in spite of which a
general truce of several years was concluded, beneath which
the Prince’s restless spirit chafed and fretted.</p>

<p class='c035'>There could also be little doubt that Maurice aimed at a
crown, while Barneveldt was a staunch republican. A more
deadly cause of enmity was now springing up, for the torch of
religious discord was aflame in Holland, between two opposing
sects, the Gomarites and the Arminians. The former accused
the latter of being more lax than the Papists, while the
Arminians loudly declared the Gomarites to be cruel and
intolerant, and the God they worshipped unjust and merciless.</p>

<p class='c035'>For the most part, the clergy, with many of the upper
classes, headed by Maurice and his family, favoured the
Gomarites; while Barneveldt, with the municipal body, upheld
the Arminian doctrines. Political and religious differences
waxed fiercer each day that passed, and Maurice forgot all he
owed to the guardian of his youth.</p>

<p class='c035'>Barneveldt’s star was setting; slander and calumny of all
kinds were busy with the name of this single-minded, large-hearted
old man, whom the Stadtholder did not disdain in his
anger to accuse of secret negotiations with Spain. In a letter
to the Prince, Barneveldt bewails their estrangement, for
which he had ‘given no cause, having always been your faithful
servant, and with God’s blessing, so will I remain.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He went on to say he had done good service to the State
for upwards of forty years, and as far as religious opinions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>went, he had never changed. But neither his public nor private
appeals stood him in good stead: he was denounced as
a traitor and a sceptic; libellous pamphlets, shameful and
absurd accusations, were disseminated against him. One
great bone of contention between the two sects was the convening
of a Synod, on which the Stadtholder and the States
had determined. To dissuade the Prince from this step, the
Advocate asked an interview, which was granted. Here is the
picture, drawn by a master hand: The Advocate, an imposing
magisterial figure, wrapped in a long black velvet cloak, leaning
on his staff, tall, but bent with age and anxiety, haggard and
pale, with long grey beard, and stern blue eyes. What a contrast
to the florid, plethoric Prince!—in big russet boots, shabby
felt hat encircled by a string of diamonds, his hand clutching
his sword-hilt, and his eyes full of angry menace,—the very
type of the high-born, imperious soldier. Thus they stood
and surveyed each other for a time, those two men, once fast
friends, between whom a gulf was now fixed. Expostulations,
recriminations, passed, Barneveldt strongly deprecating the
idea of the Synod, which he was well assured would only lead
to more ill feeling rather than to any adjustment of differences;
in answer to which Maurice curtly announced that the measure
was decided on, and then opposed a stubborn silence (as
was his wont when thwarted) to all the arguments and eloquence
of the Advocate. That meeting was their last on earth.</p>

<p class='c035'>Not long after this interview, as Barneveldt was one day
sitting in his garden, he was visited by two friends, of authority
in the State, who had come to warn him of the plan that
had been formed for his arrest. He received the intelligence
calmly, remarking he knew well ‘there were wicked men about;’
then, lifting his hat courteously, he added, ‘I thank you,
gentlemen, for your warning.’ He continued his steady course
as heretofore, and was accordingly shortly afterwards arrested
on his way to the Session, and lodged in prison; his intimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>friend, the learned Grotius, and several other leading members
of the Arminian community, were imprisoned at the same time.
The treatment which Barneveldt was subjected to in his captivity
was most inconsiderate and severe; indeed, the only
mercy vouchsafed to him was the attendance of his faithful
body-servant; he was not allowed communication with the
outer world, although, on more than one occasion, he contrived
to elude the vigilance of his keepers by means of a few
words concealed in a quill or the centre of a fruit. His books
and papers were taken from him; he was denied the assistance
of a lawyer or a secretary to prepare his defence, or even
pen and ink for his own use; and when he asked for a list of
the charges which were to be brought against him, he was
refused.</p>

<p class='c035'>In spite of all these hindrances, when summoned before
a ‘packed’ tribunal, his defence was noble, eloquent, and
manly, although his enemies insultingly called it a confession.
He was accused of troubling the Church of God,
sowing dissension in the Provinces, and calumniating his
Excellency, and—crowning injustice—was declared a traitor to
his native country. John Olden de Barneveldt!—was there
any one in that Assembly whose love was so profound for his
God, his country, and his Prince? He was not present when
the final sentence was passed, namely, that he should suffer
death by the sword, and that all his goods should be confiscate;
but when the news was brought, the prisoner received it with
the calm dignity which always characterised him.</p>

<p class='c035'>From ‘my chamber of sorrow’ he wrote a touching farewell
(pen and ink being grudgingly accorded him) to his
family, which he signed ‘from your loving husband, father,
grandfather, and father-in-law.’ In all these relations of life
Barneveldt had been dearly loved, and his home had been
the scene of ‘domestic bliss;’ the only paradise that has
survived the fall.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>He intrusted the clergyman who ministered to him with a
message to the Prince of Orange, assuring him that he had
always loved and served him as far as it was consistent with
his duty to the State, and his principles. He craved forgiveness
if he had ever failed towards him in any point, and concluded
by earnestly recommending his children to the care of
his Excellency.</p>

<p class='c035'>Maurice received the messenger with tears in his eyes, on
his part declaring that he had always had a sincere affection
for Barneveldt, though there were one or two things he found
it hard to forgive, such as the accusation, which the Advocate
brought against him, of aspiring to the sovereignty; but he
did forgive all, and as regarded the children, he would
befriend them as long as they continued to deserve it. With
these poor crumbs of comfort the clergyman went back to the
prison.</p>

<p class='c035'>It must not be supposed that no efforts were made to
save De Barneveldt: the French Ambassador used all his
persuasions and all his eloquence, the widowed Princess
of Orange wrote to her stepson to entreat him to save his
father’s friend, and the friend of his boyhood and early life;
but for the first time Maurice was deaf to the appeal of Louisa
de Coligny, and excused himself from seeing her on frivolous
pretences. Some surprise was expressed that the wife and
family of De Barneveldt did not petition the Stadtholder,
and it was even whispered that if either the wife or daughter-in-law
(both women distinguished by noble birth and noble
hearts) had sought an interview with Prince Maurice, it might
have been granted; but they relied on a promise, perhaps, that
no harm should come to the prisoner, even as our Strafford
did, a few years later. The venerable captive prepared for
death, declining an interview with his relations, lest the sight
of those dear ones should unnerve him, and destroy the composure
which it was so essential to maintain, while it was carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>withheld from him how earnestly his family had desired
to see him once more.</p>

<p class='c035'>The night previous to the execution his good servant took
up his post at the head of his master’s bed to receive his last
instructions, but was warned off by one of the sentinels.</p>

<p class='c035'>However, no sooner did the surly fellow fall asleep than
this faithful friend, by dint of bribes and persuasions, prevailed
on his comrade to let him return to the bedside. Barneveldt
evinced great anxiety respecting his beloved friend Grotius,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c050'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
fearing he might share the same fate. He sent tender messages
to his family, recommending the bearer to their protection,
and expressed his regret, if, stung by indignation at the
loathsome slanders published against him, he had at any time
spoken too fiercely and vehemently.</p>

<div class='footnote c052' id='f3'>
<p class='c034'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Grotius was imprisoned for two years, and finally escaped in a case of
books, through the medium of his wife.</p>
</div>

<p class='c035'>The next morning he rose quietly. ‘Come and help me,
good John,’ said he; ‘it is the last time that I shall require
your services.’ When the clergyman entered and asked if he
had slept, he said he had not, but was much soothed and
strengthened by the beautiful passages he had been reading
in a French version of the Psalms. Why linger over these
sad details?</p>

<p class='c035'>In the great hall where the judges were assembled, the
prisoner listened wearily to the long rambling sentence, and
demurred several times at its flagrant injustice. When the
clerk had concluded, he said, ‘I thought, my Lords, the States-General
would have had enough of my life, and blood, without
depriving my wife and children of their property. Is this my
recompense for forty-three years of service to the Provinces?’</p>

<p class='c035'>The President rose with this cruel reply on his lips: ‘You
have heard the sentence—away, away! that is enough.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The old man obeyed, leaning on his staff, and, followed
by his faithful John and the guard, he passed on to death on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>the scaffold, and, looking down, addressed the mob: ‘Men,’
he said, ‘do not believe that I am a traitor; I have lived as
a patriot, and as a patriot I will die.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He himself drew the cap over his eyes, ejaculating, ‘Christ
shall be my guide; O Lord, my Heavenly Father, receive
my spirit.’ Then kneeling down, as he desired, with his face
directed towards his home, he begged the executioner to use
all despatch; the heavy sword was swung, the noble head
was struck off at a blow, and the soul of John Olden de
Barneveldt took flight for a land where ingratitude and injustice
are alike unknown.</p>

<p class='c035'>We are told that the Stadtholder sat in his cabinet with
closed doors, and forbade any one wearing his livery to go
abroad, or be seen in the streets during the execution of the
Advocate; nay, it is further recorded that he evinced some
emotion on hearing that all was over. But sadly did he
neglect an opportunity that presented itself, not very long
afterwards, of showing some spark of that generosity which
once characterised him.</p>

<p class='c035'>Barneveldt had left two sons, both high in position, and
in affluent circumstances, until their father’s sentence reduced
them to poverty and obscurity. The younger son, Governor
of Bergen-op-Zoom, was a wild, turbulent spirit, and had given
his family much uneasiness. Stung to the quick by his father’s
wrongs, he laid a plot for the assassination of the Stadtholder;
with some difficulty he prevailed on his more timid brother
to enlist in the same cause, and as Maurice’s popularity was
already on the wane, he found several conspirators not unwilling
to join. The scheme was discovered or betrayed, and
all implicated therein, who had the means of escape, fled;
the younger De Barneveldt was conveyed in a case to
the house of a friend at Rotterdam, whence he started for
Brussels, and reached the Court of the Archduchess Isabella,
who took him under her protection. He afterwards entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>his native country with alien troops as a traitor and a
renegade. His less fortunate, less blameable brother, wandered
about from place to place a miserable fugitive, and was
at last taken in the island of Flieland.</p>

<p class='c035'>On hearing of his capture, his mother’s anguish knew no
bounds; she remained for days tearless, speechless, immoveable;
but at length she roused herself, and, accompanied by
her daughter-in-law and infant grandchild, she went her way
to the Stadtholder’s palace.</p>

<p class='c035'>Bowing the lofty spirit which had hitherto upheld her in
all her misfortunes, she cast herself on her knees, and with all
the wild eloquence of maternal sorrow, she implored mercy
for her son.</p>

<p class='c035'>Maurice received her with cold courtesy, and asked why
she had never raised her voice in behalf of the prisoner’s
father. The answer was worthy the widow of the great
patriot:—</p>

<p class='c035'>‘My husband,’ she said, ‘was innocent; my son is
guilty.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The Prince was unmoved, and coldly replied that it was
out of his power to interfere with the course of justice. The
two unhappy women and the little one, who was so soon to be
an orphan, passed out of the room, and all hope of mercy was
at an end. The only clemency shown the son of Olden de
Barneveldt was exemption from the ignominy and anguish of
torture which was inflicted on his fellow-conspirators. The
deportment of this weak-minded man at his trial formed a sad
contrast to that of his illustrious father. When sentence of
death had been passed, he had a last interview with his
mother and wife. The latter, amid all the agony of her grief,
exhorted her husband to die as became his father’s memory
and the noble name he bore. These loving commands were
strictly obeyed. The prisoner was calm and composed on
the scaffold, and in a few words he addressed to the people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>told them that evil counsel and the desire for vengeance had
brought him to so sad an end. His last audible word was
‘Patience.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The days of Maurice of Nassau were also numbered. For
a short time the flame of popularity flickered; but his reputation
had suffered, not only by his injustice, but by his severity
to the widow and family of a man to whose memory his very
opponents in religion and politics were now beginning to
render tardy justice. On one occasion the Stadtholder was
deeply mortified, when, crossing the public square of a large
town, amid a concourse of citizens, he was allowed to do so
without the slightest sign of recognition, without the lifting of
a single hat, or the raising of one shout in his honour. No
man said, ‘God bless him;’—he who was wont to ride down
the streets amid deafening cries of ‘Long live Prince
Maurice!’</p>

<p class='c035'>He was thwarted and opposed in many of his favourite
measures by the very party he had so strenuously upheld.
He was more especially mortified when they refused the
subsidies he asked for the prolongation of the war with
Spain, and, though successful in his attempt on Bergen-op-Zoom,
he failed before Antwerp, while the reverses of the
Protestant army in Germany weighed heavily on his mind.
He received the exiled King and Queen of Bohemia at the
Hague with generous hospitality, and sympathised truly in
their misfortunes; but the successes of his great rival, the
Marquis Spinola, which he was now powerless to withstand,
seemed the culminating point to his distress. His last days
were embittered by the knowledge that his beloved stronghold
of Breda, on the recovery of which he had expended so much
ingenuity, and run such enormous risks, thirty-four years before,
was now hotly besieged by the great Italian general, and
he himself unable to lift a finger in its defence. Maurice of
Nassau became thin and haggard, and fits of sleeplessness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>reduced his strength,—he who his life long had slept so
heavily that two gentlemen were stationed in his bedchamber
to awake him in any case of emergency. He died in the
spring of the year 1625.</p>

<p class='c035'>Maurice, Prince of Orange, had announced his intention
early in life never to marry, a resolution to which he adhered;
but he was a man of pleasure, and not very refined in his
tastes. He left several natural children, of whom one, M.
de Beverweert by name, was distinguished, and held a high
office under Government. Maurice’s chief pastime was chess,
at which (singular as it may appear) he was not very skilful.
His customary antagonist was a captain of the guard, one
De la Caze, greatly his superior in the game; but as the
Prince hated defeat, and would burst forth into fits of fury
when worsted, his prudent adversary was frequently induced
to allow his Excellency to be victorious in their trials of
skill. On these propitious occasions the Prince’s good-humour
knew no bounds, conducting the officer to the outer
door, and bidding the attendants light, and even accompany
him home. The captain, whose income depended chiefly on
his skill at games of chance, was sorely put to it in the choice
of winning and losing, of times and of seasons.</p>

<p class='c035'>Maurice merited the name of ‘the Silent’ more than his
father; and when he did speak, says La Houssaye (whose
Memoirs throw great light on the history of the time), ‘Il se
servoit toujours, de petites fraizes gauderonnées.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He was of a dry and caustic humour, and showed especial
contempt for what he considered coxcombry in dress. He
used to rally the French gentlemen in particular on the
lightness of their apparel, observing they would rather catch
cold than conceal their figures. He depreciated the use of
tight riding-boots, which prevented the horseman from vaulting
into his saddle, and set an example of simplicity, sometimes
amounting to shabbiness, in his own attire.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>We have given elsewhere the description of his usual dress.
La Houssaye says, ‘Je l’ai toujours vu habillé de la même
sorte, de la même couleur, ce qui étoit brune, couleur de musc.’
He blamed the Italian mode of horsemanship, with all their
curvetings and caracolings, which, he said, were dangerous,
and lost no end of time. Maurice left behind him a glorious
reputation, but a heavy blot rests on his escutcheon.</p>

    <div>SIR ANTONIO MORO.</div>
    <div class='c000'><i>Black suit and ruff. Black cap.</i></div>
    <div class='c000'>BORN 1512, DIED 1588.</div>

<div class='c033'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/dc-h.jpg' width='100' height='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
HE was a native of Utrecht, and a disciple of
John Schoorel, who was distinguished not
only as a painter, being a pupil of Mabuse,
but as a poet and orator. Moro travelled
in Italy, and studied the great masters. He
painted historical and sacred subjects, but
excelled in portraits, and followed the style of Holbein.
Cardinal Granvelle recommended him to Charles <span class='fss'>V.</span>, for whom
he painted Prince Philip, afterwards Philip <span class='fss'>II.</span> of Spain. The
Emperor gave Moro a commission to the Court of Portugal,
to execute the portraits of King John <span class='fss'>III.</span>, his wife, Catherine
of Austria, and the Infanta Mary, afterwards Queen of Spain.
Sir William Stirling, in his delightful work on Spanish painters,
says, ‘Moro’s pencil made that marrying monarch, Philip <span class='fss'>II.</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>acquainted with the forms and features of his two first
wives, the Maries of Portugal and England.’ For the three
Portuguese pictures the painter received six hundred ducats,
besides a costly gold chain, presented to him by the nobles of
the country, and other gifts. But when he went to England
to take sittings of Queen Mary (the betrothed of Philip of
Spain), Antonio was remunerated still more magnificently.
He received one hundred pounds (then esteemed a large sum)
for the Queen’s likeness, and a splendid chain of gold, with a
pension of one hundred pounds a quarter on his appointment
as painter to the Court. He remained in England during the
whole of Mary’s reign, and both the Queen and her husband
sat to him several times. He also painted numbers of the
courtiers and nobility, but, from omitting to annex the names,
the identity of many of his characteristic portraits is lost.
Horace Walpole regrets this neglect in his notice of Moro,
and says truly, ‘The poorest performer may add merit to his
works by identifying the subjects, and this would be a reparation
to the curious world, though it would rob many
families of imaginary ancestors.’</p>

<p class='c035'>When Queen Mary died, Moro, or More, as he was called
in England, followed King Philip to Spain, where he remained
for some time in high favour. He left the country
suddenly, and the cause of his departure has been differently
accounted for by different writers. The version of the story
most currently believed is as follows:—King Philip frequented
the artist’s studio, and one day, as he was standing
beside the easel, his Majesty familiarly placed his
hand on Moro’s shoulder. The painter turned round
abruptly, and smeared the Royal hand with carmine. The
attendants stood aghast at this breach of etiquette; but the
King appeared to treat the matter as a jest. It was not long,
however, before Moro received a warning from his patron that
the officers of the Inquisition were on his track, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>he was in imminent danger of arrest on the plea of having
‘bewitched the King.’</p>

<p class='c035'>One thing was certain, that the fact of an alien standing
so high in Philip’s favour had aroused a feeling of ill-will and
jealousy among the courtiers, who would probably lay hold of
any pretext to effect the favourite’s ruin. Moro fled to
Brussels, where he was warmly welcomed by the Duke of
Alva, then Governor of the Low Countries; here he painted
the portrait of the brave but cruel commander, and of one or
two of his mistresses. It was rumoured that Philip invited
him to return to Spain, and that Alva intercepted the letters,
being unwilling to part with the great artist. Be this as it
may, Moro never again put himself in the power of the
Inquisition, but passed the remainder of his days in ease, and
even opulence. He had amassed a good fortune by his
works in all parts of Europe, and the Duke of Alva made him
receiver of the revenues of West Flanders, an appointment
which is said to have so elated Moro that he burned his easel
and destroyed his painting tools; but we are not bound to
believe a story so unlikely.</p>

<p class='c035'>He died at Antwerp, while engaged in painting the
Circumcision for the Cathedral of that city. Sir Antonio was
remarkable for the refinement of his manners and the dignity
of his bearing. He painted several portraits of himself, one
of which represents him as a tall stately man, with a frank
open countenance, red hair and beard, dressed in a dark
doublet, with slashed sleeves, a massive chain round his throat,
and a brindled wolf-hound by his side.</p>

THE eldest son of the fifth Earl, by Emily, only
daughter of the first Viscount Melbourne.
He went from a preparatory school at Mitcham
to Eton, and thence to Trinity College,
Cambridge. On leaving the University,
he entered the Royal Horse Guards, Blue,
and became M.P. for Canterbury. In Lord Palmerston’s first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Administration Lord Fordwich was appointed Under-Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs,—an office the arduous duties and
grave responsibility of which proved too much for his health,
which was never very strong, and he accordingly sent in his
resignation at the end of a few months. In 1833 he married
Lady Anne Florence, Baroness Lucas, eldest daughter of Earl
de Grey, and two years after he retired from public life
altogether. He succeeded his father in 1837. Lord Cowper
was a staunch Whig, and always supported his party in the
House, otherwise he took no leading part in politics; he was
extremely popular, in spite of a certain diffidence which never
wore off in his contact with public and official life, or general
society. Perhaps it might be said (in the case of a man of
his great wealth and exalted position) to have enhanced the
charm of his refined and engaging manners and proverbially
musical voice. He enjoyed society, of which he was a cheerful
and agreeable member, and few houses were more celebrated
for their delightful reunions than Panshanger, near Hertford.</p>

<p class='c035'>The circumstances attending Lord Cowper’s death were
most unexpected and painful. He was Lord-Lieutenant of the
county of Kent, a post that was in some measure irksome to
him, as it entailed frequent residence in a neighbourhood
where he had few acquaintances,—with the exception of Lord
Sydney, one of his most valued and intimate friends. These
two noblemen had arranged to go down together to Maidstone
at the time of the Sessions, on the occasion of the reorganisation
of the militia. But at the eleventh hour Lord Sydney
was prevented accompanying his friend, as his presence was
required in London in his capacity of Lord Chamberlain.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Lord-Lieutenant therefore went down alone, and
while transacting business in court he was taken suddenly ill,
removed to the governor’s residence in the gaol, and died the
same evening, apparently unaware of his danger.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Lady Cowper had some friends dining with her in St.
James’s Square, when she was summoned in all haste to
Maidstone. She started immediately, accompanied by her
brother-in-law, William Cowper (the present Lord Mount
Temple), and the family physician, Dr. Ferguson. But, alas!
they arrived too late, for all was over.</p>

<p class='c035'>The death of a man so much esteemed in public, so
tenderly beloved in private life, caused a profound sensation;
and, says the friend to whom we are indebted for these
particulars, ‘few men have ever been more widely and
deeply lamented.’ Lord Cowper left two sons and three
daughters:—</p>

<p class='c041'>The present Earl; the Honourable Henry Cowper, M.P.
for Hertford; Lady Florence, married to the Honourable
Auberon Herbert, brother of the Earl of Carnarvon;
Adine, married to the Honourable Julian
Fane, fifth son of the eleventh Earl of Westmoreland,
both deceased; and Amabel, married to Lord Walter
Kerr, second son of the seventh Marquis of Lothian.</p>

HE was the fourth and youngest son of the first
Viscount Melbourne, by Elizabeth Milbanke.
Educated at Eton and Cambridge. Called
to the bar, and went the Northern Circuit
for a short time; but the law was not to his
taste: he preferred the pursuit of literature,
and took great interest in the drama. He became an active
member of the Committee of Management of Drury Lane
Theatre, with Lords Essex and Byron, and the Honourable
Douglas Kinnaird, for colleagues. He was the author of some
operatic pieces and fugitive poems, and he also published a
translation of Catullus. In the year 1819 George Lamb stood
for Westminster, on the Whig interest, against the Radicals;
the contest lasted fifteen days, and Lady Melbourne, a keen
politician, exerted herself in the canvass, and was much
pleased at her son’s return by a large majority. At the general
election in 1820 he had to relinquish his seat, but in 1826
he was returned for Dungarvan (through the interest of the
Duke of Devonshire), which borough he represented in four
Parliaments. In Lord Grey’s Administration Mr. Lamb was
appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department.
In 1809 he married Mademoiselle Caroline Rosalie Adelaide
de St. Jules, who was reputed to be a natural daughter of the
Duke of Devonshire. George Lamb died at Whitehall in
1834; his two elder brothers, Lords Melbourne and Beauvale,
survived him. He left no children.</p>

SHE was the eldest daughter and co-heir of
Thomas Philip, Earl de Grey, K.G., by
Lady Henriette Cole, daughter of the first
Earl of Enniskillen. She married in 1833
George Augustus, sixth Earl Cowper, and
was left a widow, in 1856, by the sudden
and unexpected death of her husband. We cannot do better
than transcribe the moral portraiture of the late Lady Cowper,
sketched by the hand of one who knew her well, appreciated
her highly, and who, moreover, bore a strong resemblance to
her in many moral and intellectual gifts:—</p>

<p class='c035'>‘I think I can sum up Lady Cowper’s leading attributes in
three words—wit, wisdom, and goodness. In the relationship
of daughter, wife, and mother she left nothing to be desired;
as a hostess she was pre-eminently agreeable, being a most
delightful companion; she had lived with all that was politically
and socially distinguished in her day, and had read all
that was worth reading in modern literature. She derived
keen enjoyment from “the give and take” of discussion; her
opinions were decided, and their expression fresh and spontaneous:
into whatever well it was lowered, the bucket
invariably came up full!’</p>

<p class='c035'>‘In her latter days, even under the pressure of failing
health, her conversational powers never flagged; she was most
brilliant in the freshness of morning, and shone conspicuously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>at the breakfast-table, thereby rendering that repast far more
animated than is usually the case. Her sallies, though never
ill-natured, were often unexpected and startling, which added
a zest to her discourse, and gained for her the title of ‘The
Queen of Paradox.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Her loss was deeply felt and mourned, not only in her
own family, but in the wider range of what is termed social
life.</p>

COUNTESS COWPER was the daughter of
Charles Gore, Esquire, of Southampton.
Her parents took her to Italy for her health,
where the family resided for a long time.
Mr. Gore is supposed to have been the
original of Goethe’s ‘travelled Englishman’
in <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>. Mrs. Delany, in one of her amusing
letters, mentions the meeting of Lord Cowper and Miss Gore
at Florence, ‘when little Cupid straightway bent his bow.’</p>

<p class='c035'>They were married at Florence, and on that occasion
Horace Walpole condoles with Sir Horace Mann on the prospect,
as he would lose so much of the society of his great friend,
Lord Cowper. Both Lady Cowper and her husband were in
high favour at the Grand-Ducal Court of Tuscany, and the former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>was a great ornament of the brilliant (but by no means straight-laced)
society of the day. Miss Berry speaks in very high
terms of Miss Gore, who resided with her married sister.
Three sons were born to the Cowpers in Florence. In
her later days the Countess took up her abode at a villa a
little way out of the city. She survived her husband many
years, and was said to have been plundered by her servants.
Indeed, this most interesting picture is supposed to have been
stolen at the time of her death. It was purchased in 1845 by
the Honourable Spencer Cowper (for the trifling sum of £20),
who made it a present to his brother, the sixth Earl.</p>

WILLIAM, second Lord Melbourne, was
born March 15, 1779. His father and
mother were friends of the Prince of Wales,
and lived in that brilliant Whig circle of
which Fox and Sheridan were the political
ornaments, and the Duchess of Devonshire
the Queen of Beauty. It is difficult now to realise the spirit
of that society, in which dissipation and intellectual refinement
were so singularly combined. Drunkenness among the men
was too frequent to be considered disgraceful, and even those
who passed for being sober took their two or three bottles a
day. Conversation was habitually interlarded with oaths;
gambling, to such an extent as to cripple the largest fortunes,
was the common amusement of both sexes; and morality in
other respects was in a low state. But joined with this there
was that high sense of personal honour, which in England, and
still oftener in France, has, at other times, been united with
similar manners. There was more than this. There was a
spirit of justice and generosity—even of tenderness—and in
some cases a delicacy of feeling which we are accustomed now
to associate only with temperance and purity. There was also
a very cultivated taste, derived from a far more extensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>knowledge of the Classics than is to be found in these days;
a love of poetry and history; and, above all, an enthusiastic
worship of liberty.</p>

<p class='c035'>How came this strange worship of liberty among this
exclusive and luxurious aristocracy? Originally, perhaps, as
the result of faction. Excluded from power and deprived of
popularity by misfortunes and mistakes, which it would take
too long to mention, the Whigs had been driven in their
adversity to fall back upon their original principles. The
debating instinct of their great Parliamentary leader seized
upon the cry of liberty as a weapon of warfare in the House of
Commons, and the cause which he advocated was so congenial
to his frank and generous nature that he embraced it enthusiastically
and imparted his enthusiasm to his friends. I must
not pursue these thoughts further, but the circumstances of a
man’s early life have such influence in moulding his character
that, even in such a slight sketch as this, it may not have been
out of place to call attention to the state of that society, with
its vices and its redeeming qualities, in the midst of which
William Lamb grew up.</p>

<p class='c035'>He went to Eton in 1790, and to Cambridge in 1796. In
1797 he was entered at Lincoln’s Inn, but without leaving
Cambridge. In 1798 he won a prize by the oration on ‘The
Progressive Improvement of Mankind,’ which was alluded to
by Fox in the House of Commons.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1799 he went to Glasgow to Professor Millar’s, from whose
house he wrote during this and the following year several
letters to his mother, which still exist. They show the keenest
interest in politics, and an enthusiastic admiration for the
French; and they are not entirely free from a slight taint of
that apparent want of patriotism which infected the Liberal
party at that time, and which did it such irreparable damage.
It is only fair to say that there is an entry written in a notebook
a few years later showing how keenly he appreciated and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>lamented this political error, and throughout the whole course
of the Peninsular War he expresses the warmest wishes for
the success of the British arms, and for those of our allies in
Germany.</p>

<p class='c035'>His career at the bar was brief and uneventful, and by the
death of his elder brother he shortly became heir-apparent to
his father’s title and property.</p>

<p class='c035'>We now come to a most important event—important to all
men—in his case particularly so, and attended with almost
unmitigated evil.</p>

<p class='c035'>On June 3, 1805, was solemnised the marriage of William
Lamb and Lady Caroline Ponsonby. It is heartless, unnecessary,
and altogether wrong to expose the dreariness, the pain,
and the ridicule of an ill-assorted marriage. Too many
particulars of this unhappy union have already found their way
into print. Lady Caroline was a woman of ability, and, I
suppose, a certain amount of charm; but nobody who reads
her works, or her letters, or the accounts of her conduct, can
doubt that she was partially insane. Of her husband it is
enough to say that whatever his faults may have been of over-indulgence
at certain times—and perhaps an occasional outbreak
of passionate temper at others—he was, on the whole,
singularly tender, kind, and considerate. He was always
honourable and gentlemanlike, and he bore his burden with a
brave and manly spirit. But for twenty years his life was
embittered, his ability depressed, and even his credit with the
world temporarily impaired.</p>

<p class='c035'>I have said that the evil which attended his marriage was
almost unmitigated; but there was one compensation. He
was driven into seclusion. Whole days were passed in his
library, and it was during these years that he acquired habits
of reading which were never afterwards abandoned, and that
he accumulated much of that vast store of learning—that large
knowledge of all subjects, ancient and modern, sacred and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>profane—which formed a continual subject of astonishment to
those who knew him in later life.</p>

<p class='c035'>After endless quarrels and reconciliations, they were
regularly separated in 1825; but he occasionally visited her,
and was with her at her deathbed two years later, when they
were finally reconciled, to quarrel no more.</p>

<p class='c035'>Though he was member of the House of Commons for
many years, and occasionally spoke, he cannot be said to
have acquired any distinction in that assembly; but his
abilities had always been recognised by leading men, as is
shown by the fact that he twice refused office during that period.</p>

<p class='c035'>His public career began in 1827, when he accepted, in
Canning’s Administration, the post of Chief Secretary in
Ireland.</p>

<p class='c035'>It is difficult to form a just opinion of him as he appeared
to his contemporaries at this time. Mr. M’Culloch Torrens
has done justice to his high character, his clear intellect, and
his broad, sound, and sensible views of men and things.
Lord Melbourne’s relations must always feel grateful to Mr.
Torrens for so clearly bringing forward this side of his
nature, and perhaps also for not attempting to delineate those
characteristics which require to be touched with a more
delicate hand. The uncontrolled flow of humour, of originality
and mischief, might easily have been perverted in
the description into buffoonery or jauntiness, from which no
man was ever more free. The paradoxes might have appeared
as an ambitious effort to astonish and to draw attention,
when considered separately from the simple and spontaneous
manner in which they were uttered. They were saved from
this, as all good paradoxes are, not only by the manner, but by
each one of them containing some portion of the truth, which
is generally overlooked, and which was then, for the first time,
presented to the mind in a striking and unexpected way.</p>

<p class='c035'>But though any attempt to describe the charm of Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Melbourne’s society would probably lead to disastrous failure,
and must not, therefore, be attempted, it is important to bear
in mind that this extraordinary charm was the one great
feature that remained impressed upon the minds of all who
had communication with him.</p>

<p class='c035'>Sparkling originality, keen insight into character, a rich
store of information on every subject always at hand to
strengthen and illustrate conversation, exuberant vitality, and,
above all, the most transparent simplicity of nature, these,
from what I have heard, must have been his principal characteristics.
I am bound to add that he often shocked fastidious
people. He seldom spoke without swearing, and he was often
very coarse in his remarks. There was, indeed, in his language
and in his whole character, not only a wayward recklessness
which was natural to him, but a touch of cynical bitterness
that contrasted strangely with the nobleness and generosity
of the original man. The nobleness and generosity were, I
say, original. The scenes which surrounded him in his early
years, and still more, that unhappy married life to which I
have already alluded, may account for the remainder.</p>

<p class='c035'>I must add that this charm of manner and conversation
was set forth to the utmost advantage by a beautiful voice
and a prepossessing personal appearance. He was tall, strong,
and of vigorous constitution, brilliantly handsome, even in
old age, with a play of countenance to which no picture, and
certainly not this very indifferent one by Hayter, does the
smallest justice.</p>

<p class='c035'>It may easily be believed that with such a people as the
Irish a man like this immediately became extremely popular;
and the solid abilities of a genuine statesman were speedily
recognised by his colleagues.</p>

<p class='c035'>Even at this period, with Lord Wellesley as Viceroy, the
principal business in Ireland was transacted by the Chief
Secretary, though this Minister was not then, as he has frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>been since, in the Cabinet. Lord Wellesley, accustomed
to a far different position in India, was occasionally
somewhat sore at the false relation in which he stood to his
nominal subordinate, though this was made as endurable as
possible by the tact and fine feeling of William Lamb, who
was constantly reminding the Ministers in England of the consideration
due to a veteran statesman, whom fate had placed
in so disagreeable an office, and offering to send back despatches
to be rewritten.</p>

<p class='c035'>The short Administrations of Canning and Goderich were
uneventful in Ireland, and early in that of the Duke of
Wellington, Lamb resigned. He came away with an increased
reputation. His extreme facility of access, and his delight in
talking openly with people of all parties, had made him much
liked—and even his very indiscretions seem to have told in
his favour.</p>

<p class='c035'>On July 22, 1828, he became Lord Melbourne by the
death of his father.</p>

<p class='c035'>In Lord Grey’s Administration of 1830 he was made
Home Secretary. His appointment to so important an office
without any public reputation as a man of business, and
without any Parliamentary distinction, show conclusively what
a high opinion had been formed of his abilities by those in
authority. But by the world at large he seems to have been
still looked upon as an indolent man, and to have caused
some surprise by the vigour and ability which he displayed in
dealing with the very serious disturbances which at this time
broke out in many parts of the country. This unexpected
vigour, joined with the calmness and good sense which he
was already known to possess, made his reign at the Home
Office very successful; and he had an opportunity of particularly
distinguishing himself by his firmness and discretion
in dealing with a monster deputation from the Trade Unions
shortly before he was called to fill a still higher position.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>In 1834, on the resignation of Lord Grey, he was sent for
by the King. He formed a Government from his existing
colleagues, and from that period, with the exception of a short
interval, he remained Prime Minister of England for seven years.</p>

<p class='c035'>The political history of these seven years has been written
over and over again. It was a history to which the Liberal
party cannot look back with much satisfaction, and the memory
of the Prime Minister suffers unjustly in consequence. It was
one of those strange periods of reaction which are so familiar
to the student of English political life, when the country was
becoming daily more Conservative in its views and feelings.
Then, as at other similar periods, the Liberals were obstinately
unwilling to believe the fact. While the bulk of the electors
were ever more and more anxious for repose, ardent politicians
were racking their brains for new stimulants, and seeking what
reforms they could propose, and what institutions they could
attack, in order to rouse the flagging energies of their supporters.
They mistook a real wish to be left quiet for a disgust
at not being led forward, and as the activity of Lord Melbourne
in his Cabinet was chiefly displayed in restraining the
restlessness of the more impetuous of his colleagues, he became
responsible, in the eyes of some, for the want of progress;
while the nation at large accused him, in common with the
rest of his Government, of continually taking up, without
serious consideration or depth of conviction, any policy which
might be likely to bring a momentary popularity to the
Ministry.</p>

<p class='c035'>In regard to this last accusation, we must remember that
Lord Melbourne was only one of the governing committee of
the country—<i>primus inter pares</i>. It is a very strong and very
popular Prime Minister alone who can be more than this. His
influence, as I have said, is believed to have been a restraining
one. We know the mistakes to which he was a party, but we
shall never know how many he may have prevented.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>After all said against it, this period of seven years was
neither unfruitful in wise legislation nor inglorious to the
country. Without endangering peace, we maintained the high
position of England in Europe; and though many measures
were prematurely introduced, and hastily abandoned, a long
list may be made of very useful ones which were passed.</p>

<p class='c035'>What were Lord Melbourne’s real political convictions?
Some have said that he was in his heart a Conservative. He
was undoubtedly less advanced in his opinions than many of
his colleagues, and he sometimes exhibited a half-laughing,
half-sorrowful disbelief in the result expected by others from
constitutional changes. This, coupled with a love of mischief
and a delight in startling people, made him appear less
advanced than he was—as when he said about Catholic
Emancipation, that all the wise men in the country had been
on one side of the question, and all the fools on the other,
and that the fools had turned out to be right after all; when
he told some ardent reformers that the men who originated
the Reform Bill ought to be hung on a gallows forty feet high;
and when he remarked to Lord John Russell that he did not
see that there was much use in education. These remarks,
however, did not express his real convictions. His was
essentially that kind of mind which sees clearly both sides of
a question. His position would naturally have been very near
the border-line which divides the two parties, and on which it
is impossible for any public man in England permanently to
stand, but it would have been, under any circumstances, on
the Liberal side of that line.</p>

<p class='c035'>As leader of the House of Lords he was, on the whole,
successful—certainly not the reverse. But he had the misfortune
to be opposed and most bitterly attacked, during a
great part of his Administration, by the two greatest orators of
the day, and he received little support from his own side. Of
his speaking it has been said that if it had been a little better,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>it would have been quite first-rate. He never prepared a
speech, and he hesitated a good deal, except when under the
influence of excitement. But at his worst he was always plain,
unpretending, and sensible; and his voice and appearance
were of themselves sufficient to command attention. When
roused he could be forcible, and even eloquent for a few
minutes, and he always gave the impression that he only
wanted rousing to become so. The most powerful of his
opponents never could feel sure that he might not at any
moment receive a sudden knock-down blow, and both
Brougham and Lyndhurst more than once experienced this.</p>

<p class='c035'>On the accession of the Queen in 1837, Lord Melbourne
found himself suddenly placed in a most trying and most responsible
position. This is the part of his career which is best
known, and in which his conduct has been most appreciated;
and I do not think there is any other instance on record of
the confidential and affectionate relations subsisting between
a Sovereign and a Minister so interesting to dwell upon. It
is difficult to say to which of the two these relations were
productive of the greatest benefit. Her Majesty was indeed
fortunate in finding such a counsellor; his large-minded
fairness, his impartial appreciation of the motives and feelings
of all parties in the State—that philosophical power of seeing
both sides of a question, to which I have alluded, and which
perhaps stood in his way as a party leader,—were, under present
circumstances, of unmixed advantage. His vast political and
historical knowledge supplied him with ready information on
every subject, which I need hardly say he imparted in the most
agreeable manner; and his judgment, stimulated by the
gravity of the situation, enabled him to give sound advice, at
least on all the deeper and more important matters which
properly belonged to his position. To the Minister himself
this new stimulant was invaluable. His life had never quite
recovered from the blight cast upon it in his early manhood.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>He had long suffered from want of an object for which he
really cared; his thoughtful temperament too much inclined
him in his serious moments to realise the vanity of all things;
but he now found a new interest which animated his remaining
years of activity, and which afterwards solaced him in illness,
in depression, and intellectual decay.</p>

<p class='c035'>Nobly did the Queen repay this chivalrous devotion and
this unselfish solicitude for her welfare. Her clear intellect
readily assimilated his wisdom, and her truthful and just
nature responded sympathetically to his enlightened and
generous views. And there was no ingratitude or subsequent
neglect to mar the harmony of the picture, for to the last hour
of his existence her kindness and attention were without a
break. Her Majesty has been fortunate in many of her
advisers—fortunate more particularly in her illustrious husband,—but
such is the force of early impression, that, perhaps,
no small part of the sagacity and the virtue which have
signalised her reign may be traced to the influence of Lord
Melbourne.</p>

<p class='c035'>This little biographical notice must now be concluded.
In 1841 his Administration came to an end. In the autumn
of 1842 he had a paralytic stroke. He recovered, and
lived till 1848, and was able to take his place in the House of
Lords, and to appear in society. But his sweet temper was
soured, and his spirits became unequal; his bright intellect
was dimmed, and his peculiarities assumed an exaggerated
form. He had been so famous in earlier days for the brilliancy
of his conversation, that even after his illness people remembered
and repeated what he said. This has done his reputation
some injury, and the stories told about him do not always
convey a correct impression of his ability or his charm.</p>

<p class='c035'>The life which I have attempted to sketch was an eventful
one, and Lord Melbourne took no small share in the movements
of his time. But it seems to have been the impression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>of all who met him, that he might have done much more than
he ever did, and that he was a far abler and greater man than
many who have filled a larger space in history.</p>

HE was the eldest child of the first Lord Melbourne,
and his birth was a source of great
joy to both his parents. But from his
earliest years Peniston was the idol of his
father, whom he resembled in many points,
both moral and physical; indeed, it was
said no flattery was sweeter to Lord Melbourne’s ear than to
be assured of this resemblance. The mother was very fond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>of her first-born; but as he grew on in years, and his tastes
developed, Lady Melbourne was mortified to find that
Peniston evinced no predilection for politics or public life;
and, finding in her second son William’s tastes more congenial
with her own, it was plain to see that William was the mother’s
darling. Peniston showed no jealousy; he was gentle-hearted
and engaging; every tenant on the estate, every servant in the
house, every dog and horse in the stable, loved him. He
was a capital shot, and rode well to hounds, while quite a
little fellow; and Lord Melbourne was never tired of telling
how ‘Pen’ had led the field, or put his pony at the stiffest
bullfinch. His brothers were among his most devoted worshippers;
and in their happy romping days at Brocket,
Peniston was never tired of joining in their frolics, though
with a certain dignity becoming a senior. How exquisitely
is this characteristic demeanour portrayed in the beautiful
picture of the three boys by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which he
named ‘The Affectionate Brothers,’ described in a late page.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1793 Lord Melbourne vacated his seat in Parliament,
and Peniston represented Newport, and afterwards Hertfordshire
county, in the House. He had never been very strong,
and being suddenly attacked by an illness, for which the
physicians could in no way account, he expired, to the despair
of his father, the grief of his whole family, and the deep
regret of the county. Reynolds, Romney, Mrs. Cosway, and
Stubbs, were all called on to perpetuate the handsome form
and features of this darling of the household.</p>

GRANDSON to Spencer Cowper (the celebrated
Judge), and Deputy-Clerk of the
Parliaments for many years. There is an
entry in Mary Countess Cowper’s diary
(wife of the Chancellor) in December 1714:
‘Monsieur Robethon received the grant of
the King of Clerk of the Parliament after Mr. Johnson’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>death for anybody he would name. He let our brother
Spencer Cowper have it in reversion after Mr. Johnson’s death
for his two sons for £1800.’ It was held in succession by the
family for several years. The reader of the poet Cowper’s
life will remember the tragical incident connected with this
particular appointment.</p>

HE was the eldest son of Thomas Robinson,
second Lord Grantham (of that name), by
Lady Mary Yorke, second daughter of the
second Earl of Hardwicke. Succeeded to
the barony of Grantham on the death of his
father, and to the earldom of De Grey on the
death of his maternal aunt (who was Countess De Grey in her
own right), and at the same time he assumed the surname of
De Grey, in lieu of that of Robinson. In 1805 he married the
beautiful Lady Henrietta Cole, fifth daughter of the first Earl of
Enniskillen. He was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty,
and Privy Councillor during Sir Robert Peel’s Administration of
1834 and 1835, and on the return of Peel to power in 1841 Lord
De Grey went to Ireland as Viceroy. Here he made himself
remarkable by his extreme hospitality and the splendour of his
establishment, while he discharged the more essential and
difficult duties of his office with zeal and ability. His departure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>in 1844 (when he resigned on account of his health) was much
regretted, while Lady De Grey left a name which was long
remembered in Dublin, not only for the charm of her manners
and the beauty of her person, but for the encouragement which
she afforded to native talent and manufactures. On leaving
Ireland Lord De Grey retired from official life, and contented
himself with voting in Parliament as a Liberal Conservative.
He became Lord-Lieutenant of Bedfordshire, Knight of the
Garter, and aide-de-camp to the Queen. He was a member of
many scientific and industrial institutions, Fellow of the Royal
Society, and of the Society of Antiquarians, etc. He had
several children, of whom only two daughters survived,—Anne
Florence, who married the sixth Earl Cowper, and Mary,
married to Captain Henry Vyner. Lord De Grey died in 1859,
when the barony of Lucas devolved on his eldest daughter,
and his other titles on his nephew, now Marquis of Ripon.
He was a man of undoubted talent, and occupied himself in
carrying out designs as an architect, decorator, and landscape
gardener. When he inherited the houses of Wrest, in Bedfordshire,
and the fine mansion in St. James’s Square, on the
death of his aunt, the Countess De Grey, he pulled down the
former, and rebuilt it, according to his own designs, in the
style of a French château. The pictures which adorn the
walls were painted expressly for him; the tapestry, which
lends so rich a colouring to the interior of Wrest, was woven
under Lord De Grey’s immediate direction in the ateliers of
the Gobelins; while the rich gilding, cornices, and ceilings
were all executed under his supervision, and do the greatest
credit to his taste and ingenuity. He also supplemented
the plans, and enlarged the ornamentation of the already
beautiful gardens and pleasure-grounds which surround the
house.</p>

HE was the third son of the first Viscount
Melbourne, by Elizabeth, daughter of Sir
Ralph Milbanke. He entered the diplomatic
service at an early age, was successively
attached to the British Legation at Palermo,
and the Embassy at Vienna, where in the
year 1813 he became Minister Plenipotentiary, <i>ad interim</i>,
until the arrival of Lord Stewart, afterwards Marquis of Londonderry.
From September 1815 he was Envoy to Munich
until 1820, and two years later he was appointed Privy Councillor,
and subsequently G.C.B. (civil), in consideration of his
diplomatic services. He was successively Minister to Madrid
and Ambassador at Vienna, and retired on a pension in 1841,
having previously been elevated to the Peerage by the title of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>Baron Beauvale. On the death of his brother William in 1848
(some time First Lord of the Treasury), the Viscountcy of
Melbourne devolved on him. Lord Beauvale married at
Vienna in 1841 the daughter of Count Maltzahn, the Prussian
Minister at the Austrian Court. He had no children, and his
large property was inherited by his only sister, Viscountess
Palmerston. He died at his country house, Brocket Hall, in
Hertfordshire, in 1853.</p>

of the Chancellor, who makes frequent
mention of him in her Diary. At his death
his nephew Earl Cowper annexed the name

THE daughter of John Clavering, Esquire of
Chopwell, county Durham, a younger branch
of an ancient Northumbrian family, all
Jacobite in their tendencies. Mary Clavering
and William Cowper became acquainted
in consequence of some law transactions, on
which she had occasion to consult him at his chambers.
Their marriage took place shortly after he was appointed Lord
Keeper of the Great Seal. ‘The wooing was not long a-doing;’
but it was far from being calm or uninterrupted in its
progress; and though Lady Cowper’s Diary, from which
most of our materials are taken, does not commence till 1714,
when she began her Court life, yet she goes back several years
to tell us how many adverse influences were at work to prevent
the union, which proved so well assorted. How my Lord,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>being a widower when the Queen gave him the Seals, it was
no wonder (particularly as he was still young and very handsome)
that the young women laid out all their snares to catch
him. Lady Harriet de Vere especially marked him as her
prey. This lady, daughter of the last Earl of Oxford of that
family, was very poor, and of a damaged reputation. She had
made several advances to my Lord through her kinswoman,
Mrs. Morley, but finding nothing come of it, set a spy on his
actions, and dogged his steps to find out the cause of this
coldness, which turned out to be no other than pretty Mistress
Mary Clavering; upon which a clandestine correspondence
was begun,—letters purporting to be from some great
personage, and threatening him with the ruin of his official
prospects if he married the lady in question. The first
letter came the day before the marriage; but as the union
was kept a secret, the plotters still continued to prosecute their
schemes. ‘And so for months my Lord had a letter of
whole sheets every day to tell him I was a mean wretch and
a coquette, and the like, and how that one night the Lord
Wharton (a noted profligate) had said to my Lord Dorchester
at the theatre, “Now let us go and hear Molly Clavering sing
the opera all over again.” Which was a lie, for I never did
play in any public company, but only at home when visitors
asked me.’ Some time afterwards the Lord Keeper agreed to
accompany one Mrs. Weedon (who said she had a fine lady
to recommend to him), in order to discover who his clandestine
correspondents were, and found his suspicions confirmed,
for Lady Harriet de Vere and Mistress Kirke were the very
ladies who waylaid and ogled him whenever he came out of
chapel. Lady Harriet was full of ‘airs and graces,’ which
were of no avail. She told Lord Cowper that the Queen was
very anxious she should be married, and had promised to give
her a dowry of £100,000, upon which the gentleman replied,
on that score he durst not presume to marry her, as he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>not an estate to make a settlement answerable to so large a
fortune. At length they pressed him so hard, he was forced
to confess he was already married, and that, in spite of all their
abuse, he could only find one fault in his wife, and that was
that she played the harpsichord better than any other woman
in England. Now Lady Cowper says she never would have
told this story had she not thought it incumbent upon her to
do so, when the Duchess of St. Albans (Lady Harriet de
Vere’s sister) recommended Mrs. Kirke as a fit person to be
bedchamber woman to the Princess of Wales. For some
reason, public or private, perhaps a combination, the Lord
Keeper kept his marriage a secret at first. In one of his
letters to his wife (with whom he kept up a brisk and affectionate
correspondence) he says: ‘December, 1706. I am
going to visit my mother, and shall begin to prepare her for
what I hope she must know in a little time.’ In another letter
he gives an account of a cold, dark journey, and how his only
consolation was to think her journey was shorter, and by day-light,
so that he was not in fear for what he was most concerned
for.</p>

<p class='c035'>In answer to her declaring she disliked grand speeches, he
agrees, and thinks the truest love and highest esteem are able
to give undeniable proofs of themselves; therefore he shall
depend for ever on making love to her that way. A little
later he writes playfully about the lady he has carried into the
country (presumed to be a fat old housekeeper); and hopes
that the picture of his ‘dear life’ may soon be finished, so as to
console him in some measure in his next banishment. He
begs her not to imagine from anything that may look a little
trifling or cheerful in his letters, that his mind is constantly in
that tune: ‘’Tis only when I enjoy this half conversation
with you, who, I assure you, are the only satisfaction that I
propose to my hopes in this life.’ Again, he cannot go to
rest without expressing his concern and amazement at her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>collecting ‘so much disquiet from so harmless a passage,—’tis
my want of skill, if it was not the language of a lover.’
He writes at great length to dispel his dear love’s ‘melancholy
fancy,’ and values no prospect in life as the continuance of
her favour, and the unspeakable satisfaction he shall ever
derive from doing her all the good in his power; and
so on.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Diary of Mary, Lady Cowper, was published from
private documents at Panshanger in 1864, and, though fragmentary,
is very interesting. It commences with the accession
of George <span class='fss'>I.</span>; and the writer tells us she had been for some
years past (apparently through the medium of Sarah, Duchess
of Marlborough) in correspondence with Caroline of Anspach,
Princess of Wales, who had written to her most kindly.
Lord and Lady Cowper were both strongly in favour of the
Hanoverian succession, the wife having embraced her husband’s
political opinions in contradistinction to those of her
father. On the arrival of the Royal Family, Lady Cowper
was kindly received, but the offer of her services was evasively
answered by the Princess, so much so that she took it for
granted ‘Her Royal Highness had had so many applications
on the subject that she could not take me into her service. I
therefore resolved not to add to the number of her tormentors,
and never mentioned the thing any more.’ She was confirmed
in her opinion when she heard that two ladies had been
already appointed, and she well knew ‘that the necessity of
affairs often forces Princes to act contrary to their inclinations.’
The coronation took place in October 1714, and thither Lady
Cowper went with Lady Bristol (herself a candidate for a post
in the Princess’s household), who told her companion she
well knew that she (Lady Cowper) was to get an appointment.
The two ladies found the peeresses’ places so full that they
had to seek accommodation elsewhere, and Lady Cowper
settled herself next the pulpit stairs, when Lady Northampton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>and Lady Nottingham came hand in hand; and the latter
‘took my place from me, and I was forced to mount the
pulpit stairs. I thought this rude; but her ill-breeding got
me the best place in the Abbey, for I saw all the ceremony,
which few besides did, and never was so affected with joy in
my life.’ Here follows an amusing account of how Lady
Nottingham broke from her place, and kneeled down in front,
which nobody else did, facing the King, and repeating the
Litany. ‘Everybody stared, and thought she had overdone
the High Church part. The Lords over against me, seeing
me thus mounted, said to my Lord “that they hoped I would
preach,” upon which he answered “that he believed I had
zeal enough for it,” whereupon Lord Nottingham made some
malicious remark, said with such an air, that, joined with what
Lady Nottingham had done that day, and some other little
passages that had happened, opened my eyes, and showed
me how that family maligned me.’ She takes occasion to
mention that the ladies not walking in procession had no gold
medals. Lady Dorchester stood next to her—Catherine
Sedley, whom James <span class='fss'>II.</span> made a peeress, and who was reported
to have said, ‘I wonder for what quality the King chooses
his mistresses; we are none of us handsome, and if we have
wit, he has not enough to find it out.’<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c050'><sup>[4]</sup></a> And when the Archbishop
went round asking the consent of the people, she
turned and said: ‘Does the old fool think that anybody here
will say no to his question, where there are so many drawn
swords?’</p>

<div class='footnote c052' id='f4'>
<p class='c034'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> said his brother’s mistresses were imposed upon him by
his confessor as a penance.</p>
</div>

<p class='c035'>The Princess asked Lady Cowper if Lady Essex Robartes
had delivered a message, and, being answered in the negative,
‘Her Royal Highness went on to tell me I had made a conquest,
and seeing me blush, continued, “It is M. Bernstorff,
who never was in love in his life before, and it is so considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>a conquest that you ought to be proud of it; and I, to
please him, have ordered him to make you a compliment
from me.”’</p>

<p class='c035'>Baron Bernstorff was indeed a good friend to have at
Court, being at that time German Minister and prime
favourite of George <span class='fss'>I.</span>, who consulted him on every appointment
of every kind. He waited on Lady Cowper the same
evening, and told her she was appointed ‘Dame du Palais,’
and was to kiss hands next day.</p>

<p class='c035'>A friendship was formed, which withstood many a change
and chance, and more than one misunderstanding. On the
Baron taking leave, the lady intrusted him with her lord’s
treatise, <i>An Impartial View of the State of Parties</i>, which
she herself had translated into French, and transcribed for his
Majesty’s perusal, who was no English scholar. ‘Great discussion
whether the Princess, on going into the city, was to
kiss the Lady Mayoress (and quoting of precedents); but as
her late Majesty had not done so, it was arranged neither
should the Princess.’ The new Lady-in-Waiting was in
attendance when Her Royal Highness went to the Lord
Mayor’s Show. ‘Poor Lady Humphrys made a sad figure in
her black velvet, bawling to her page to hold up her train,
being loath to lose the privilege of her Mayoralty. But the
greatest jest of all was that the King and Prince had been
told that the Lord Mayor had borrowed her for that day
only. I had much ado to convince them of the contrary,
though he by marriage is a sort of relation of my Lord’s
first wife.’ Query, was that a sequiter? ‘They agreed’
(Lady Cowper is quite right to record any occasion on which
the King and his son were of the same mind) ‘that if he had
borrowed a wife, it would have been a different one from what
she was.’</p>

<p class='c035'><i>October 30th</i> (Diary).—‘The Prince’s birthday: the Court
splendid; the ball opened by him and the Princess. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>danced in slippers (heelless shoes) very well; but he better
than any one.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord and Lady Cowper, from their relative positions, had
often to keep company that cannot have been very palatable
to so well-conducted a pair. ‘Supped at the Lord
Chamberlain’s (the Duke of Shrewsbury); Lord and Lady
Wharton and Madame Kielmansegge to wait on the King.
Another evening; I was mightily amused; but I could not but
feel uneasy at some words I overheard the Duchess of Bolton
say in French, which led me to believe the two foreign ladies
were no better than they should be.’ This remark alludes to
Madame Kielmansegge, the daughter of the Countess Platen
(who had been mistress to the Elector, George <span class='fss'>I.</span>’s father), and
wife of General Kielmansegge, after whose death she was
created Countess of Darlington by the King. Horace Walpole
paints a frightful picture of ‘the Ogress,’ whose appearance
terrified him when a boy. The Duchess of Shrewsbury was
an Italian lady, of wit and talent, whom Lady Cowper found
it impossible to dislike as much as her lord, for she was very
entertaining, though she would sometimes exceed the bounds
of decency. Many members of the Princess’s own household
were themselves of very doubtful reputation, and we find the
name of Mademoiselle de Schulenberg of frequent recurrence
in the Diary, a lady who had been maid of honour to the
Electress Sophia, the King’s mother, and was afterwards
created Duchess of Munster and Duchess of Kendal.</p>

<p class='c035'><i>November 8th</i> (Diary).—‘My birthday [she was twenty-nine].
God grant that the rest of my life may be passed according to
his will, and in his service.’ High play was the order of the
day at both Courts, and the Princess and her ladies sat down
every night to stake more than they possessed, while the
King was often very angry with those who would not gamble.
‘I played at basset as low as I could, for which I was rallied;
but I told my mistress I only played out of duty, and nobody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>could think ill of me if, for the sake of my four children, I
desired to save.’</p>

<p class='c035'>From numerous entries in the Diary, it would appear that
Lady Cowper was averse to spreading slanderous reports, which
were daily poured into her ear, from party feeling, respecting
many ladies of whom she had no reason to think ill; but the
quarrels and cabals at Court were endless, and daily increasing;
and she was sometimes drawn into a dispute from feelings of
just indignation, such as when my Lady Nottingham accused
Dr. Clarke (the famous controversialist, whom Voltaire called
<i>un moulin à raisonnement</i>) of being a heretic. But on being
pressed to quote the passage on which she founded so heavy
a charge, her ladyship threw up her head and replied, she
never had, nor did she ever intend, to look into his writings.
Then said Lady Cowper, ‘What, madam! do you undertake
to condemn anybody as a heretic, or to decide upon a
controversy, without knowing what it is they maintain or
believe? I would not venture to do so for all the world.
All this happened before the Princess, and was not likely to
advance Lady Nottingham’s wish to be governess to the
young Princesses.’ Taking leave of her Royal mistress at the
end of her week of waiting, she says: ‘I am so charmed with
her good qualities, that I feel I never can do enough for her.
I am come to Court with the fixed determination never to
tell a lie, and she places more confidence in what I say than
in any one else on that account.’ This was in the first year of
Lady Cowper’s service. Unfortunately her enthusiasm in
this quarter was destined to be modified. It was evidently
always a pleasure to her to bring the name of any one in
whom she was interested before the Royal notice. She told
the Prince of Wales that she never failed to drink his health
at dinner, ‘which made him smile and say, He did not wonder
at the rude health he had enjoyed since he came to England;
but I told him I and my children had constantly pledged him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>before his arrival, by the name of “Young Hanover, Brave!”
which was the title Mr. Congreve (the poet) had given him in
a ballad. The Prince, however, was not learned in English
literature, and asked who Mr. Congreve was, which gave me
an opportunity of saying all the good of him that he deserved.’
She also bestirred herself to get places under Government for
her relations, who were for the most part very ungrateful; so
much so, that she could not help answering rather pettishly,
‘that the next time they might get places for themselves, for
I would meddle no more.’ And her lord was so angry with
them, he was for depriving the offender of a commissionership
he had himself bestowed at Lady Cowper’s instigation;
‘but I soothed him, and told him after all I did them
good for conscience’ sake.’ The Lady-in-Waiting and her
Royal mistress had many a laugh together in these early
days over some of the eccentricities of Court life. Such,
for instance, as when Madame Kielmansegge came to complain
to the Princess that the Prince had said she had
a very bad reputation at Hanover. The Princess did not
think it likely—the Prince seldom said such things; but
Madame cried, and declared people despised her in consequence,
and she drew from her pocket a certificate, written
and signed by her husband, General Kielmansegge, to say she
was a faithful wife, and he had never had any reason to
suspect her. The Princess smiled, and said she did not
doubt it, but that it was a very bad reputation that wanted
such a supporter. Another specimen was Madame Tron, the
Venetian ambassadress, ‘who says, now she is come into a free
country, she will live and go about like other people. But
the Italian husband is more jealous than the German, and
often beats his wife, which she is grown used to, and does not
care about, unless he spoils her beauty. So she goes by the
name of “La Beauté, sans Souci.” But she has been heard to
exclaim, when he is chastising her, with a very Italian accent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>“Oh prenez garde à mon visage!”’ ‘Lady Essex Robartes
(daughter of Lord Nottingham) is just beginning her long
journey to Cornwall, which she does with great fear.’</p>

<p class='c035'>We cannot refrain from quoting Lady Cowper on the
drama, when the Princess consulted her respecting the propriety
of being present at the representation of ‘The Wanton
Wife,’ or, as it was afterwards called, ‘The Amorous Widow,’
written by Betterton,—the Duchess of Roxburghe having
given her opinion that nobody could see it with a good
reputation. ‘I had seen it once, and few I believe had seen
it so seldom; but it used to be a favourite play, and often
bespoke by the ladies. I went with my mistress, who said she
liked it as well as any play she had ever seen; and it certainly
<i>is not more obscene than all comedies are</i>. It were to be
wished our stage were chaster, and I hope, now it is under
Mr. Steele’s direction, that it will mend;’ from which observation
we may conclude that, at least in the particular of
morals, our English stage has not deteriorated. It was
evident the Lady-in-Waiting’s influence was high at this
moment, since the Duchess of Roxburghe begged her to try
and prevent Sir Henry St. John from being made a peer. It
was he of whom the anecdote is told, that when his son was
created Lord Bolingbroke, he said to him: ‘Ah, Harry, I
always thought you would be hanged, and now I find you will
be beheaded.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Cowper was apparently overpowered not only with
solicitations to procure places for friends and acquaintances,
but sometimes intrusted by her husband with messages of
public importance to the Prince and Princess, or that still
greater personage, Baron Bernstorff; and she seems to have
carried out her mission with much discretion on more than
one occasion, as we before remarked. The fair lady and her
friend, the German baron, came to high words. He told her
sharply one day, ‘“My Lord est beaucoup trop vif, et vous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>êtes beaucoup trop vive de votre côté. Les ministres se
plaignent beaucoup de my Lord Cowper. Ils disent qu’il leur
reproche trop souvent, les fautes qu’ils ont pu commettre.”
The wife replied, “Notre seul but est de bien servir de roi.”
He repeated his words, and then said with great violence,
“Croyez moi, vous êtes trop vifs, tous les deux, cela ne vaut
rien, cela tourne en ruine.” I believe it was the first time
that an English lady, who had bread to put into her mouth,
had been so treated. I knew whence all this storm came;
and plainly saw our enemies had got the better.’</p>

<p class='c035'>This was the time to which we have alluded in the notice
of the Lord Chancellor. Now, although more especially at
this time Lady Cowper was very desirous that her husband
should retain office, for she ‘would rather live with him in a
garret up three pair of stairs, than see him suffer,’ yet she
always answered with spirit when the subject of his resignation
was discussed. ‘Mrs. Clayton came in and told me it was
reported that Lord Cowper was going to lay down. I
answered, They say he is to be turned out, and they need not
have given themselves the trouble; if they had but hinted to
my Lord they were weary of him, he would have laid down.
They know he has done it already, which is more than ever
will be said of them.’ Though a courtier in the literal sense
of the word, Lady Cowper disdained to trim and truckle, as
most of her colleagues did.</p>

<p class='c035'>She had carried herself towards the mighty baron with distant
dignity, since the passage of arms to which we have alluded.
He made his niece, Mademoiselle Schütz, his ambassador,
to complain of having been treated distantly and coldly, never
being allowed to see Lady Cowper alone of late, and so forth.
When permitted to renew his visit, he expostulated with her
on her believing that he was willing to oust her husband; and
upon her saying she understood it was so destined by the
Ministry, the baron made a world of asseverations of how he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>was incapable of injuring the Lord Chancellor, that the King
had the greatest possible kindness for him, and that none
could take his place from him but God alone, and so forth.
Upon which Lady Cowper tossed her head and observed,
‘One must be fond of a place before you fear to lose it, and
it was too painful a place to be fond of.’ Then the baron
retorted that Lord Cowper was peevish and difficult, and so
thought the King, and he begged her ladyship would
use her best arguments to soften and make him more
compliable;—which she certainly did, though she did
not let Bernstorff into the secret, for, at least at this time
of day, she was most unwilling to see her husband vacate
the Woolsack.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Mademoiselle Schütz to whom an allusion has been
made, is thus described: ‘She was a pretty woman, and had
good qualities, but was withal so assuming that she was
mightily hated at Court. The Prince disliked her most
especially, but I saw her very often.’ Too often, as it proved
in the sequel, for the Fraülein made herself most obnoxious
after a bit, coming at all hours, when not wanted, to the
Cowpers’ house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and ‘writing at every
turn, which is very troublesome. I wish she had as many
occupations as I have. I had a letter from her to offer to
come and stay with me; I thank her for nothing. I had enough
of her impertinence last night.’ Another time she insists on
the loan of a costly pearl necklace, which the Lady-in-Waiting
wanted to wear herself (not being overstocked with jewels), at
the birthday; now it is a ‘lace head’ to go to Court in; now
she wishes for a set of gold ribbons as a gift. ‘Commend me
to a modest assurance. It lifts one out of many a pinch, I
find. Lady William Powlett complained of her too, “she is
very importunate, and always on the spunge.” I fell a-laughing,
and said, “I was very glad it had come to anybody’s share
besides mine.”</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>On the 5th of December in this year (1715), the Diary
records the entrance into London of the Jacobite prisoners
who had been taken at the battle of Preston,—their arms
tied, and their horses led by soldiers. The mob insulted them,
carrying a warming-pan before them in ridicule of the Pretender,
and saying many spiteful things, which some of the
prisoners returned with spirit. ‘The chief of my father’s
family was among them, Clavering of Callalee, who is above
seventy years old. I did not see them come into town, nor
let any of my children do so. I thought it would be insulting
to several relations I had there, though almost everybody else
went to see them. I forgot to say M. Bernstorff made me a
strange offer, through his niece, to let my cousin Tom Forster
escape on the road, if I had a mind to it.’ This gentleman
was knight of the shire for Northumberland, and was a general
in the Jacobites’ army; he had proclaimed the Pretender at
Warkworth. He was imprisoned in Newgate, but eventually
escaped.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Widdrington, who was impeached at the same time
as Lord Derwentwater, was also a connection of hers; and she
gives this as a reason she could not go to the State trials,
although her Lord presided as Lord High Steward, an
appointment which vexed her much. She gives the order of
procession, with many servants, and coaches, one with six
horses, Garter King at Arms, Usher of the Black Rod, etc.
etc. Lady Cowper did not seem to take the same delight in
the melancholy pageant as most of the fine world did, for she
says, ‘I was told it was customary to have fine liveries on
such an occasion, but had them all plain. I think it very
wrong to make a parade on such an occasion as putting to
death one’s fellow-creatures. The Princess came home much
touched with compassion. What a pity that such cruelties
should be necessary! My Lord’s speech on pronouncing
sentence was commended by every one, but I esteem no one’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>commendation like Dr. Clarke’s, who says, “’tis superlatively
good, and that it is not possible to add or diminish one letter
without hurting it.”’</p>

<p class='c035'>Many entries in the Diary now speak of Lord Cowper’s
continued illness, and how he had again a mind to quit office.
His wife, who in spite of all the squabbles and ‘unpleasantness’
she describes, was still in high favour with the Prince and
Princess, and was not insensible to the splendour and amusements
of a Court life, loved her Lord above all such
considerations, and told him she ‘would never oppose anything
he had a mind to do,’ and, ‘after arguing calmly on the
matter, I offered, if it would be any pleasure done him, to
retire with him into the country, and what was more, never to
repine at doing so, though it was the greatest sacrifice that
could be made him. I believe he will accept.’ But a little
while after she says, ‘My Lord is better, and not so much
talk of retiring, though I laid it fairly in his way.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The troublesome Fraülein Schütz seemed to have chosen
this time of anxiety to be more importunate than ever about
loans of jewels and finery: ‘When she asked me for my
diamonds, saying she had less scruple in doing so because
I look best in a state of nature, and jewels do not become
me! Commend me to the assurance of these foreigners!’</p>

<p class='c035'>On a similar occasion Lady Cowper makes some very
moral reflections, slightly tempered by a dash of pardonable
vanity. After an excuse for wearing an emerald necklace,
which had been lent her lest she should disoblige her friend,
she meant also to wear her own pearls in her hair, though she
don’t care one brass farthing for making herself fine, and
hopes always to make it her study rather to adorn her mind
than to set off a vile body of dust and ashes!</p>

<p class='c035'>The advice given to Mrs. Collingwood, the wife of one of
the Jacobite prisoners, must have shocked the feelings of so
loving a wife as Mary Cowper. Mr. Collingwood, a Northumberland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>gentleman, was under sentence of death, when his
wife wrote to an influential friend to intercede in his behalf.
Here is the answer: ‘I think you are mad when you talk of
saving your husband’s life. Don’t you know you will have
£500 a year jointure if he’s hanged, and not a groat if he’s
saved? Consider, and let me know. I shall do nothing till
then.’ There was no answer to the letter, and Collingwood
was executed.</p>

<p class='c035'>About this time great exertions were made to induce the
King to reprieve some (at least) of the prisoners, and Lady
Cowper was evidently instrumental in gaining that of Lord
Carnwath, who would otherwise have suffered with Lords
Kenmure and Derwentwater. She gave a letter from the
imprisoned nobleman to the Princess, who wept on reading
it, and sent word in answer that if Lord Carnwath would
confess, she would give him her honour he should be saved,
but that was the only way. Now, though the King was not
over partial to ‘cette Diablesse de Princesse,’ as he often
called her, yet the violent language and opinions she sometimes
held were not altogether without their influence on the
Royal mind. Lord Nithisdale escaped by the connivance of
his devoted wife, and Lord Carnwath was reprieved. ‘God
grant us peace to heal all our divisions, and to take away the
rancour that is among us.’ ‘Lord Nithisdale’s escape
confirmed; I hope he’ll get clear off; I never was better
pleased at anything in my life, and I believe everybody is the
same.’</p>

<p class='c035'><i>March 1.</i>—The Princess of Wales’s birthday. ‘I am ill,
but must go to wish her many years of health and happiness,
which I unfeignedly do, for she’s a most charming delightful
friend as well as mistress.’ Her Royal Highness said M.
Bernstorff had been urging the Prince to agree to Lord
Cowper being made President of the Council, which the Prince
refused to do, unless assured that Lord Cowper wished it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>‘I said Lord Cowper was ready to quit, if they found anybody
better to put in his room, but would never change that
of which he could acquit himself with honour, for that he
could not perform at all.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Party ran so high in this year (1716), that even a
meteorological phenomenon—‘a light so great that from my
windows I could see people walk across Lincoln’s Inn Fields
though there was no moon’—was pressed by Whigs and Tories
into their interests,—the former saying it was God’s judgment
on the horrid rebellion, the latter that it was a mark of vengeance
on the Whigs for the late executions. Mr. Gibson, the
antiquary, says it has ever since been spoken of as ‘Lord
Derwentwater’s lights.’ Lady Cowper was coming home in
her chair on the night in question, and her bearers were so
frightened that she was forced to let her glass down and preach
to them all the way to comfort them. She observes that if
anybody had overheard the dialogue they could not have
helped laughing.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Cowper’s chairmen were apparently not very efficient
altogether; she twice complains of the shifts she was put to
in consequence of their drunkenness, and her having to come
home in the first hackney she could find. Another time she
lost her servants altogether, and had to borrow the Duchess of
Shrewsbury’s chair. The bickerings and altercations between
the Court ladies were interminable, more especially between
the German and English; and no wonder, when the Germans
talked as one of their great ladies did, saying that ‘English
ladies did not look like women of quality, but pitiful and
sneaking, holding their heads down, and always seeming in
a fright, whereas foreigners hold up their heads and hold out
their bosoms, and look grand and stately;’ upon which Lady
Deloraine replies, ‘We show our quality, madam, by our birth
and titles, not by sticking out our bosoms.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The Diary tells us that on May the 29th, those who disliked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>the reigning family wore green boughs, and on June the
10th (the Pretender’s birthday) white roses. Nothing now but
cabal and intrigue, petty Court jealousies, bitter hatred and
enmity among the political parties, the ins and the outs,
and unseemly quarrels between the two highest in rank in
the country.</p>

<p class='c035'>It was settled that the King was to go to Hanover for at
least six months, the question of the Regency during his
absence being the worst bone of contention of all. But we
have treated this subject more at large in the notice of Lord
Cowper, who was constantly peacemaking and pouring good
counsel into the ears of the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p class='c035'>Diary.—‘For my part, I thought it so absolute a necessity
to the public good to keep all things quiet, that I did heartily
and successfully endeavour to conceal everything that tended
to disunion, little thinking at the time it could ever be called
a crime to keep things quiet.’</p>

<p class='c035'>It was finally settled that the King was to go to Hanover,
to which His Majesty looked forward with pleasure, greatly
alloyed by the necessity of making his son Regent. Always
jealous of him, he could not bear the idea of the Prince of
Wales playing at King. When it was arranged that the
Prince should be appointed to the Regency during His
Majesty’s absence, there were as many restrictions put upon
him as possible. In this summer (1716) the Court went
to reside, with much splendour, at Hampton Court Palace, and
the Diary leads us to believe there was some little enjoyment
to be derived from that comparative retirement. But even
here the spirit of unrest followed them: Lord Townshend, who
came down frequently on public business, treated the Princess
with so little respect, and paid such court to Mrs. Howard (to
curry favour with the Prince) that both Lord and Lady Cowper
expostulated with him, so effectually indeed as to prevail on
the Minister to change his demeanour, ‘which brought the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>Princess into perfect tranquillity.’ Not for long, however, for
when Lord Sunderland arrived to take leave, before joining the
King at Hanover, he fell out with the Princess walking in the
long gallery which looks on the gardens; and he talked so
loud that Her Royal Highness desired him to speak lower,
for the people in the garden would overhear him. ‘Let them
hear,’ cries my Lord. The Princess answered, ‘Well, if you
have a mind, let ‘em, only you shall walk next to the window,
for in the humour we are both in, one of us must jump out, and I
am resolved it sha’n’t be me.’ But for such stormy interludes,
and the constant disquietude which the presence of Mrs.
Howard (nor of her alone), must have occasioned the Princess,
the time passed pleasantly enough, in Wolsey’s picturesque old
palace, so lately increased in magnitude by the additions of Sir
Christopher Wren. The gardens and pleasances too had been
much improved and enlarged, for Queen Mary’s delectation,
and the Princess, who was a great walker, spent many hours
under the leafy shades of the lime grove, and wandering among
the dark yews and evergreens.</p>

<p class='c035'>Diary.—‘The Prince and Princess dined every day in
public in Her Royal Highness’s apartments. The Lady-in-Waiting
served at table, but my ill-health prevented me doing
that service. In the afternoon my Royal mistress saw company,
and read or writ till evening, when she walked in the garden
for two or three hours together, and would go to the pavilion
at the end of the bowling-green (which runs parallel with the
river) to play there, but after the Countess of Buckenburgh
fell and put her foot out, the Princess went there no more, but
played in the green gallery. The Duchess of Monmouth was
often with us, and the Princess loved her mightily, and,
certainly, no woman of her years ever deserved it so well.
She had all the fire and life of youth, and it was marvellous
to see that the many afflictions she had suffered had not
touched her wit and good-nature, but at upwards of threescore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>she had both in their full perfection.’ We cannot resist
inserting this generous testimony to one who was distinguished
by Royal favour at a time when petty jealousies and intense
rivalry were at their height. Their Royal Highnesses left
Hampton Court with part of their retinue by water, and as
they glided along in a Royal barge, Lady Cowper thought
‘nothing in the world could be pleasanter than the passage, or
give one a better idea of the richness and happiness of the
kingdom.’ A break now occurs in the Diary, which began
1714, and which we have followed up to October 1716. That
portion which concerned the next four years is not forthcoming,
and the editor gives us a clue to the reason. In a
memorandum by the Chancellor’s daughter, Lady Sarah, she
copies a letter written to the postmaster at Hertford: ‘It is
reported that at the time of the trial of the Bishop of Rochester
Lord Cowper offered to be bail for him, which was so resented
by a certain person of distinction that he moved for a warrant
to search his Lordship’s house. News of this was sent to Lady
Cowper, and though the report was to be despised, yet my
mother had so many hints and intimations sent her by different
people of a design to attack my father and try to involve his
character in the examination then on foot, relating to Layer’s
plot, that she took fright for some papers she had drawn up
by way of diary, also some letters belonging to the Prince and
Princess, which she had in her hands, relating to the quarrel
in the Royal Family, that, not being able to place them in
safety, in a hurry she burned such as she thought likely to do
most harm.’ This is a reasonable explanation of the disappearance
of the records of 1717, 1718,and 1719. In 1718 Lord
Cowper resigned office, to the great regret of all well-thinking
persons of whatever party, the details of which will be found
in the Chancellor’s life. The feuds in the Royal Family had
augmented in frequency and violence during these four years,
and Lady Cowper resumes her narrative at a time when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>scandal of these quarrels was so great as to render a reconciliation
imperative on public grounds. Lord Cowper himself
had lost much of the King’s favour by his adherence to the
Prince, and the fair Lady-in-Waiting herself had to undergo
many cold looks, and, what must have been more trying to
such a steadfast nature as hers, the caprice and wayward
moods of the mistress she still loved and served most loyally.
New influences were at work, and new favourites on the scene.
As to the reconciliation, though made a subject of public
rejoicing, it was hollow enough. The King lost few opportunities
of slighting his son and daughter-in-law, and he plagued
her much, particularly on the vexed question of the custody of
her children, who had been removed from her care. But we
are anticipating. The Diary re-opens with a visit from Mr.
Secretary Walpole (afterwards Sir Robert) to the Princess of
Wales, with offers of reconciliation from the King, April 9,
1720. The Princess referred him to Lord Cowper, who lost
no time in hastening to the Royal presence to discuss the
matter.</p>

<p class='c035'>The conditions were most unpalatable to the Prince and
Princess, who were ‘in great anguish.’ They both asked the
advice of Lord and Lady Cowper, and took that of Mr. Secretary
Walpole. Among many leading men of the day, whom
the Lady-in-Waiting had no reason to love, were that Minister
and Lord Townshend in particular, and she did not approve
of Walpole’s confession to my Lord, that he did almost everything
through the medium of the Duchess of Kendal, who
was ‘virtually Queen of England.’ Lady Cowper also complains
that her mistress has been taught to suspect her all the
winter, and that the Prince scarcely looks at her, and she
marvels how Walpole has got such a hold of them that they
only see through his eyes, and no longer recognise their real
friends. Would not the leafy shades of Cole Green form a
pleasant contrast to this vortex of antagonism?—so at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>thought Lord Cowper, ‘who is sick of the whole affair, and
goes out of town to hear no more of it, and it is more than
odds, if he is not pleased with his treatment, that he will carry
me with him.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Grand rejoicings in honour of this reconciliation. Lady
Cowper goes to congratulate the Prince and Princess: ‘The
square full of coaches, the guards before the door, everything
gay and laughing, everybody kissing, and wishing of joy.
When I wished the Prince joy he embraced me, with all his
old heartiness, five or six times, and the Princess burst into a
loud laugh, and said: “Sir, I do think you two always kiss on
great occasions.” All the town feignedly or unfeignedly happy.
I kissed Lord Cowper on coming home, and said: “Well, I
thank God your head is your own, and that is more than
could be said six months ago.”’ And then she alludes to all
the intrigues that were being carried on, and says: ‘There
was not a rogue in the town but was engaged in some scheme
and project to undo his country.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The King still very distant to his son and daughter-in-law
(with occasional variations of humour), and speaking of
the pending change of Ministry, asked angrily if the Whigs
could not come back, without the Prince of Wales. We have
mentioned in Lord Cowper’s life how many overtures were
made to him to return and resume office on the return of the
Whigs to power. He came to his wife’s bedside one Sunday
morning to let his ‘dear girl’ into his secrets,—how that he
had thought with her to take service again, and that he had
always considered a reconciliation so necessary, that it would
help to make everything in its own condition again. And ‘I
did think to accept of that offer made me, of my friend
Kingston’s place, who has behaved himself so shamefully to
me, that it would be a piece of justice upon him.’ But that,
on further consideration, all his reasons for quitting office subsisted
still. ‘I am old and infirm, and rich enough, and am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>resolved not to enslave myself to any power upon earth. At
five-and-fifty it is time to think of making life easy. My
infirmities will not let me struggle with knaves and fools. My
tranquillity will content me more than all they can give me,
under their power and influence.’ His wife said all she could
to dissuade him from this decision, and he agreed with some
of her arguments, but declared he thought any reproach better
than the loss of his tranquillity, and that his resolution was
taken. But to show he was not out of humour, he would ask
for the key which had been promised Lady Cowper, and that
he would accept a place in the Cabinet, but neither place nor
pension, for he was resolved to live a freeman and an Englishman.</p>

<p class='c035'>We have inserted this characteristic speech of Lord
Cowper’s here, rather than in the notice appropriated to him,
because it was made in private to his wife, and is recorded in
her Diary. No wonder that after such a conversation, Lady
Cowper was often tempted to answer the Princess and others
with some degree of asperity when they insinuated that her
lord was a place-hunter. The day before the new Ministry
came in, she was in attendance on the Princess, and the new
Lord Chancellor was there. ‘I dare say, Lady Cowper,’ said
Her Royal Highness, laughing, ‘you are glad to see the purse
in that hand.’ ‘Yes, truly,’ she replied; ‘I am right glad,
and hope it will remain there until that hand is as weary of
it as ours was.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Diary.—‘Lord Cowper invited to the ministerial dinner;
does not mean to go. Great hugging and kissing between the
two old and the two new Ministers. They walk all four with
their arms round one another to show they are all one.’ Now,
though Lord Cowper could not be persuaded to change his
resolution as regarded himself, he was most desirous to obtain
the post of Mistress of the Robes for his wife, to whom the
Princess had promised it, and who seemed best fitted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>position, politics, and character, in all the Court. But the
King wished the Duchess of St. Albans to remain, and that
lady had ‘locked up the key in her cabinet, and did not
intend to resign, unless compelled to do so.’ Lord Cowper
waited several times on the Princess with the intention of
urging his wife’s claim, but Her Royal Highness gave him no
opportunity, and the lady was sorely aggrieved. ‘The Princess
not willing to give me the key, yet she promised it. And
when the King asked for some one else, she said: “Remember
the obligations I am under to Lady Cowper, no one else can
have it.” But now, she says, “Lady D. [Deloraine?] will be
disobliged.” What claim has she?—is it for flying all over
Richmond with the Prince?’</p>

<p class='c035'>‘A new clamour for the Duchess of St. Albans. I am
quite sick of this usage. Why did the Princess promise me
the key, if she had not the power to give it? To what purpose
such dissimulation? Sure she thought me a tame fool,
who was to be easily imposed on, and who had not her
interest at heart. The Germans used to call her, “Une grande
comédienne:” I say no; if actors played their parts in such a
manner they would be hissed off the stage, and must starve.
She has disobliged the two best friends she ever had.’ Here
follows a little bit of natural petulance. ‘There is indeed a
great advantage in going to the drawing-room to be used as
ill as Lord Sunderland pleases; he has undoubtedly taken
care to betray his master for at least thirty pieces of silver; it
were well if he would follow out the whole example, and go
and hang himself.’ Alas for the change in Mary Cowper’s
opinion of Caroline of Anspach, and her surroundings! She
gives us a sarcastic speech made by the Archbishop of Canterbury
(Wake), showing to the Princess his opinion of the state
of public matters and public men at that crisis, which we
therefore insert:—</p>

<p class='c035'>‘Madam, we must now wish ourselves and the world joy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>First of this happy reconciliation, and next of the honour,
integrity, and disinterestedness of the Ministers, as well as their
wisdom and virtue. They would be matchless were they not
equalled by the two great governors of this Court, Townshend
and Walpole. What glorious things must we not expect from
the conduct of the first in the Ministry and the two last here?
What happiness for the people to be under such directors!
and what a glorious figure we must make all the world over
when we are influenced by such counsels!’</p>

<p class='c035'>‘No, sure, my Lord,’ answered the Princess, somewhat
meekly; ‘those men are not our only advisers—what do you
make of Lord Cowper?’</p>

<p class='c035'>‘Oh! madam,’ replied the Archbishop, ‘he is not fit to
be put on a level with such great men.’ Then the Archbishop
asked her plainly if the Duchess of St. Albans was to have
the key?</p>

<p class='c035'>‘No, never!’ she said; ‘though she is always tormenting
me about it.’</p>

<p class='c035'>‘My Lord into the country for good; leaves me to
get everything ready. Busy packing all day. The Princess
asks why Lord Cowper leaves London; and answer, “To
avoid importunity, and be quiet.” “And what makes you
go so soon?” “Because he commands me, madam, and I
have nothing to do but to obey.”’</p>

<p class='c035'>The Cowpers still kept up their friendship with Baron
Bernstorff, who was himself subject to the most capricious
treatment in high places, and the German Baron, and the
Lady-in-Waiting had many long discussions on political
matters.</p>

<p class='c035'>They were agreed on many subjects, and above all in
abhorrence of the South Sea Scheme, which was then the great
topic of the day. ‘Go into the country, nothing material there.’
But she ‘came back to go to the birthday of our most gracious
King.’ ‘Waited on the Princess to Court, where was one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>the greatest crowds I ever saw; it being greatly increased by
our new Lords and Masters of the South Sea, who had more
court made to them than the Ministers themselves.’</p>

<p class='c035'>As a climax to the confusion that reigned between the
rival Courts, the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle,
chose to celebrate His Majesty’s birthday-night by getting
drunk, in consequence of which the ladies of the Princess’s
household had no places, but ‘stood in the heat and crowd
all night.’ The Duchess of Shrewsbury scolded aloud,
which only elicited insulting answers from the great official,
and so indignant were the Princess’s ladies, that they all went
home, with the exception of my Lady Dorset.</p>

<p class='c035'>Here is another mention of the Chamberlain: ‘Newcastle
stood before me both day and night. If I had not seen his
face I should have known who it was, it being his peculiarity
to turn his back upon those he has any obligations to.’
Another incident in Lady Cowper’s Court life shows the
Princess of Wales could be flippant as well as capricious, but
her attendant was a match for her. ‘She had a mind to be
out of humour with me, and put on a frown. The King turned
his back to me who was playing. But a sudden curiosity
took him, and he turned his face round, and had his eyes
fixed on me all night so intently, without being angry, that it
was talked about. The Princess said to me next morning, that
the King could not help liking me as well as ever; and that
she saw plainly by his manner that I could do what I pleased,
and that it was my own fault if I did not rule them all. I
answered, for the thing itself I did not believe it at all, and,
supposing it were true, power was too dear bought when one
was to do such dishonourable work for it.’</p>

<p class='c035'><i>July 5.</i>—‘My waiting concluded without my having had
any opportunity of saying one word to the Princess alone,
without the door being open;’—her Royal mistress, whom she
so much loved, and by whom, but a short time ago, she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>been trusted, and consulted on every subject, public or private.
It is probable Lady Cowper found much truth in a passage in
one of the Duchess of Marlborough’s letters to her, though, as
far as one could tell, her Grace’s taste did not always incline to
private life! ‘I don’t wonder that you find it melancholy to
be away from your Lord and children, for though the Princess
is very easy and obliging,’—this was as early as 1716,—‘I think
any one who has common sense or honesty must needs be
weary of everything one meets with at Court. I have seen a
good many, and lived in them many years, but I protest I was
never pleased but when I was a child; and after I had been a
maid of honour some time at fourteen I wished myself out of
the Court as much as I wished to come into it before I knew
what it was.’</p>

<p class='c035'>We have been tempted step by step into lengthening our
record of Mary, the first Countess Cowper, not only because
we have authentic records of herself, and the Court she
adorned, from her own pen, but because in those records we find
so much nature and simplicity of style, so many evidences of
her sterling qualities, her many accomplishments and excellent
judgment, the whole tempered by playful sallies and pardonable
petulance. A modest and well-conducted woman in a
vicious Court, and uncontaminated by the immorality of those
with whom she was compelled to associate; the worthy wife
of a good and great man, whose loss she could not endure.
She closed his eyes, and four months afterwards she once
more lay by his side in their last resting-place.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Cowper died in October 1723, and ‘in the latter end
of December,’ says Lady Sarah Cowper, ‘my mother grew
much weaker, and extremely ill. She lost her appetite, and at
times her memory, so that she would speak of my father as
if living, ask for him, and expect him home. When she
recollected his death, it was with so lively a grief as if it had just
happened. In short, she had really what is so often talked of,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>so seldom seen, a broken heart. She died on the 5th of
February 1724.’</p>

<p class='c035'>She expected him home; he did not come, and so she went
to join him in ‘the Court of Heaven.’</p>

SHE was the younger daughter of John Lord
Carteret, afterwards Earl Granville. Her
sponsors were King George <span class='fss'>II.</span> and his
Queen, hence her baptismal names. In
1733-4 a contemporary paper announces her
marriage:—‘The bride, a beautiful young
lady, with a portion of £30,000, to the Hon. John Spencer,
brother to the Duke of Marlborough, and grandson to Sarah,
Duchess Dowager of Marlborough.’ John, or ‘Jack,’ as he
was familiarly called, was one of those reckless spirits, who, in
the days of which we are speaking, went by the name of
‘Rattlebrains,’ being very wilful, merry, extravagant, and
the best company in the world! Better to laugh, talk, or
drink, than to transact any business with. By this description
it will be seen that between him and his aged grandmother
there were many points of resemblance, and in consequence
the Duchess was very partial to her scapegrace grandson.
They fell out, it must be confessed, over and over again, but
Jack always contrived to coax, cajole, or joke himself back
into favour. On one festive occasion, when Sarah was presiding
at the head of her own table at Althorp, supported by
a crowd of daughters, sons-in-law, grandchildren, and what
not, in the pride of wealth, relationship, and splendid
surroundings, she said aloud, ‘Here am I, the root, encircled
by my branches.’</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>‘True,’ says mischievous Jack, at the bottom of the table, in
a whisper to his neighbour; ‘pity that the root should not be
in its proper place, under ground.’ The young man to whom
the sally was addressed was thrown into such convulsions of
laughter that the Duchess’s curiosity was aroused, and she
insisted on knowing the cause of so much mirth. Few people
dared to gainsay the aged virago, and certainly not this timid
youth; thus questioned, he had neither the courage nor the
imagination for a false or evasive answer, and he blurted out
the bare truth. The Duchess rose in a fury. ‘Leave the
room, Jack,’ said she; ‘leave the house, and never darken my
doors again.’ The culprit obeyed with an air of mock submission,
and on reaching the door he turned, and with a
profound salutation, quitted the apartment. But in another
moment his head appeared above the sill of the window, which
was open. He cleared it at a bound, vaulted into the room,
and knelt at his grandmother’s feet. It was the window, not
the door! A perfect reconciliation ensued; and so completely
was Jack forgiven, that the Duchess settled a considerable
annuity on him, pending the large fortune and estates he
would inherit by her will, in addition to those left in trust for
him by his grandfather the Duke.</p>

<p class='c035'>Mrs. Delany, in her amusing diaries and letters, published
of late years by Lady Llanover, to whom many thanks are due
for the same, speaks constantly of her cousin Georgiana
Granville, with an obvious pride in the relationship. She says,
in writing to her sister, ‘You will expect to hear some account
of our cousin Spencer. The marriage took place between
eight and nine o’clock at night. The guests were very distinguished,—the
Dukes and Duchesses of Marlborough and
Bedford, Sir Robert and Lady Worsley, the bride’s grandparents,
and numerous members of their family, Lord Morpeth,
Colonel Montagu, etc. etc. After they were married, they
played a pool of commerce, then retired between twelve and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>one, and went next day to Windsor Lodge. They are to
return on Monday, to what was Mr. Percival’s lodging in
Conduit Street. Georgiana was dressed in white satin,
embroidered in silver, her laces very fine, and the jewels the
Duchess of Marlborough gave her, magnificent. Frequent
allusions are made by the writers of the day to these famous
jewels in which Mrs. Spencer ‘sparkled.’ Then follows a
catalogue of the bride’s wedding bravery, of laces and linen
very fine, and flowered silks, such as would rouse the envy of
many a lover of old brocade in modern times; a pink and
silver poudesoy, a blue damask night-gown, and rich brocades,
all stiff with embroidery.</p>

<p class='c035'>John Spencer dying, his widow contracted a second marriage
with Lord Cowper, and Mrs. Delany speaks of the union as
being a very happy one, for ‘Georgiana is much attached to
her new Lord and his children, and it is warmly reciprocated.’
Horace Walpole, in describing the gorgeous sight which the
coronation of George <span class='fss'>III.</span> and his Queen presented, gives an
amusing account of the preparations for the same among the
ladies: how several were dressed overnight, and reposed in armchairs,
with watchers beside them to wake up the sleepers when
in danger of ruffling their garments or tumbling their headdresses.
Walpole conveyed Ladies Townshend, Hervey,
Hertford, and Anne Conolly, with Mrs. Clive, to see the show
in his deputy’s house at the gate of Westminster Hall. Says
Lady Townshend, ‘I should like to go to a coronation, for I
have never seen one.’ ‘Why,’ remarked Horace, ‘you walked
at the last.’ ‘Yes, child,’ was the candid reply, ‘but I saw
nothing; I only looked to see who was looking at me.’ There
seemed to have been a great stir among the Countesses, who
all objected to associate with Lady Macclesfield. Horace
again: ‘My heraldry was much more offended with the ladies
who did walk, than with those who walked out of place, but I
was not so furiously angry as my Lady Cowper. She flatly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>refused at first to set a foot with my Lady Macclesfield, and
when at last compelled to do so she set out at a round trot’
(to distance her companion?), ‘as if she designed to prove the
antiquity of her family by walking as lustily as a maid of
honour of Queen Guinevere.’ Mrs. Delany writes later on,
‘Lady Cowper is very much pleased at her son being made
an Earl, and all the more as the honour was entirely unsolicited.’
Lord Spencer was a generous and dutiful son, and when his
mother once more became a widow, he gave her a charming
house at Richmond, fully furnished, where she was very
hospitable to Mrs. Delany and that branch of her family, as
well as to the relations and connections of both her husbands.
Here her ‘cousin’ frequently mentions meeting Lady Spencer
and her mother, Mrs. Poyntz, Anne Maria Mordaunt, who had
been maid of honour to Queen Caroline, and governess to the
Duke of Cumberland. Lady Cowper’s letters are lively
and genial. In one, dated New Year’s Day, she says, ‘Last
evening came Lord Montagu (only son of the Earl of
Cardigan, created Baron Montagu). He spent most of the
evening alone with me, and I played on the guitar, and sang
to him. I hope we may not be talked about, for he is quite
alive, I assure you, although he is fourscore struck, as the
Duchess of Marlborough used to say.’ Georgiana retained her
good looks to a very advanced age, for Mrs. Delany says, not
long before her death, ‘I saw Lady Cowper yesterday. She is
still the Glastonbury Rose.’ During her last illness, which was
of some duration, her daughter-in-law, Lady Spencer, was unremitting
in her attentions, driving over daily from her home
at Wimbledon to Richmond, sometimes twice in the twenty-four
hours, and often passing the night by the sufferer’s bedside.</p>

THE daughter of the first Earl, Lord Chancellor
Cowper, by his second wife, Mary
Clavering. Mrs. Delany in her lively and
good-natured gossip makes frequent mention
of Lady Sarah, with whom she became
well acquainted, her ‘cousin Carteret’
being Lady Sarah’s sister-in-law. This was Georgiana
Carteret, Lady Cowper, of whom we have just given a notice.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘I envy you, says Mrs. Delany, writing to a friend, ‘for
living in the neighbourhood. There is quite a happy nest of
brothers and sisters. Lady Sarah has taken a little cottage
to be near Lord Cowper, to whom she is tenderly attached.
We had a delightful day when we drank tea at Panshanger,
and we walked through a beautiful wood, Mrs. Poyntz
and her daughter being of the party. Her daughter had
married Lord Spencer, Lady Cowper’s son by her first
husband. Lord and Lady Cowper took us to Cole Green,
a good large house, with nothing in it except, oh! such
a picture!’ This is an allusion to the magnificent portrait,
by Vandyck, of Count John of Nassau Siegen and
his family. Lady Sarah did not long enjoy the facilities
which her little cottage afforded of constant intercourse
with her relatives. She fell into bad health, which
entailed great suffering, and died in 1758, making a sad gap
in the happy family circle.</p>

HE was the son of Sir Matthew Lamb of Brocket
Hall, county Hertford (originally in the
possession of the Winnington family), by
Charlotte, daughter of the Right Honourable
Thomas Coke, and sister and heir of Charles
Coke, who died suddenly at Geneva, leaving
a very large fortune. Sir Peniston Lamb, besides inheriting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>half a million at his father’s death, came in for a considerable
sum, the savings of his uncle, the Bishop of Peterborough,
and to his accumulated wealth he added considerably by his
alliance with the beautiful heiress, Miss Milbanke, in 1769.</p>

<p class='c035'>He was a member of the House of Commons for many
years; and in 1770 he was created an Irish Peer by the title
of Baron Melbourne of Kilmore, county Cavan; in 1780 he
was made a Viscount. He was handsome, gentlemanlike,
genial, fond of the country and of sport, but had no love for
study. On the contrary, he was illiterate for a man in his position;
and one or two of his early love-letters to the celebrated
actress, Mrs. Baddeley, have been quoted as examples of bad
grammar and spelling. He was very popular in society, both
in London and the country. But, for his own taste, he preferred
his shooting or hunting parties to the brilliant reunions
of Melbourne House, and was the idol of the neighbourhood
round Brocket. He sat in the House of Commons for many
years, but when his eldest son was old enough, he willingly
made way for ‘Pen.’ He was one of the most indulgent of
husbands, as we have said in Lady Melbourne’s Life, and used
to declare he had given his wife her dowry back in diamonds.
He was a most tender father, his health being much affected
at the time by his son Peniston’s untimely death. The Prince
of Wales prevailed on him to turn part of his park into a race-course,
for he was easily persuaded to comply with the wishes
of others, and was very kind to his eccentric daughter, Lady
Caroline Lamb, who was fond of him in her own peculiar
way. Lord Melbourne survived his wife some years, and died
peacefully; carefully and tenderly nursed by his son William,
and his daughter, Lady Cowper.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>Miss Gore, as a Savoyard peasant. ‘Pretty enough, but I
should think it cannot do her justice, as it certainly does not
answer to her reputation for great beauty.’ She became one
of the leaders of the brilliant society at Florence, where she
was very much admired, particularly at the Grand-Ducal
Court. She survived her husband many years, living for the
most part in a villa outside the walls, where she died at an

imposed upon, and even robbed by her dependants in her

    <div>HENRY BENNET, EARL OF ARLINGTON, HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER.</div>
    <div class='c000'>BORN 1618, DIED 1685.</div>
    <div class='c000'><span class='sc'>By Sir Peter Lely.</span></div>

<div class='c033'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/dc-t.jpg' width='100' height='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE family was settled in Berkshire, when,
towards the close of the sixteenth century,
two brothers Bennet went to London, and
respectively made their fortunes by successful
commercial undertakings. From the
elder descended a certain Sir John Bennet,
living at Dawley, county Middlesex, who married Dorothy,
daughter of Sir John Crofts of Saxham, county Norfolk.
The subject of this notice was their second son. He was
educated under the paternal roof till he went to Oxford, and
was entered a student at Christ Church, where he took his
degree as B.A. and M.A., and was much esteemed both as
scholar and poet. He remained some time at the University,
where he was still a resident when the Court arrived in 1644.</p>

<p class='c035'>He was presented to King Charles, and soon after entered
the army as a volunteer. Lord Digby, then Secretary of
State, took a fancy to young Bennet, and appointed him
Under-Secretary. But this post did not interfere with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>military duties; he was ever in the field ‘when honour called,’
and was so severely wounded at Andover, in an engagement
near that town, as to be invalided for a long time. He was
indeed dangerously ill, and there is little doubt that it was in
one of these encounters that he received the scar by which he
is so well known in all his portraits.</p>

<p class='c035'>Deeply attached to the Royal cause, on the termination
of the war Bennet went to France, and on into Germany and
Italy, never losing sight of the hope of once more joining and
serving the house of Stuart. In 1649 he was summoned to
Paris by James Duke of York, to fill the post of private
secretary.</p>

<p class='c035'>King Charles, writing to his brother, says: ‘You must be
very kind to Harry Bennet, and communicate freely with
him, for as you are sure that he is full of duty and integrity
to you, so I must tell you that I shall trust him more than
any about you, and cause him to be instructed in those
businesses of mine, when I cannot write to you myself.’</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1658 Sir Henry Bennet, Knight, was sent as Ambassador
to Madrid. Clarendon says it was at the instigation of
Lord Bristol, but at this time there was strife between the
new ambassador and his former patron. Henry Bennet,
with all the zeal that usually characterises a recent convert to
Catholicism, was very anxious that his Royal master should
make his profession to the same faith, whereas Digby, or
rather the Earl of Bristol (as he had become), though himself
a Roman Catholic, considered that such a step would be
ruinous to Charles’s interests. Great bitterness in consequence
existed between Bristol and Bennet, increased by the
jealousy excited in the mind of the former with regard to the
latter’s mission, being under the impression that he himself
was far better fitted for the post.</p>

<p class='c035'>Sir Henry, however, seems to have pleased most parties
in his diplomatic capacity; and at the Restoration the King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>gave him the office of Privy Purse, and made him his constant
companion. Bennet was well calculated to suit the taste of
the Merry Monarch. Burnet tells us he had the art of
observing the King’s humour, and hitting it off, beyond all
the men of his time; and Clarendon gives us a clue to one
of the reasons, when he mentions that ‘Bennet filled a principal
place, to all intents and purposes, at the nightly meetings’
(alluding to the King’s jovial suppers in Lady Castlemaine’s
apartments), ‘added to which, he was most lively and
sparkling in conversation.’</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1662 Charles bribed Sir Edward Nicholas to resign
his Secretaryship of State (and that with a considerable sum),
that he might bestow the vacant post on his favourite. The
contrast between Bennet’s entire submission to the Royal
will, and the honest rectitude of the Chancellor (Clarendon),
increased the King’s dislike to that worthy servant of the
Crown, on whose downfall Bennet rose still higher.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1663 he was raised to the Peerage as Lord Arlington,
whereupon Clarendon threw some ridicule on the choice of
the title, taken from an obscure village in Middlesex, which
had once belonged to Bennet’s father, but was now in the
possession of another family.</p>

<p class='c035'>While at the head of public affairs, no measures of any
importance were undertaken, with the exception of the first
Dutch war.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1670 was formed the famous Cabal Ministry (spoken of
more fully in our notice of Lord Shaftesbury) which Arlington
consented to join, and of which his title formed one of the
initials.</p>

<p class='c035'>So notoriously now did he consult the King’s wishes rather
than the public good, that he was rewarded in 1672 by the
dignity of Baron Thetford and Earl of Arlington, and later
invested with the Garter. He was sent on an embassy to
Utrecht, in company with the Duke of Buckingham and Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Halifax (which was productive of no good results), and afterwards
turned his attention to the overthrow of the Cabal, in
the breaking up of which he was most instrumental. He
however fell into great disrepute with both Catholics and
Protestants about this time, the Duke of York (on the passing
of the Test Act) loading him with every kind of abuse, while
the opposite side charged him with endeavouring to introduce
Popery.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Duke of Buckingham was loud in censure of Lord
Arlington, who was impeached, and, after making a long
defence, acquitted by a small majority. He held office for
some time longer, and advocated a treaty of peace with
the Dutch, but soon after resigned office, having received
(it was said) a <i>douceur</i> from his successor of several thousands.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1674 he was named Chamberlain of the Household, in
recompense (so ran the Royal declaration) ‘of his long and
faithful services, and particularly of his having discharged the
office of principal Secretary of State to his Majesty’s entire
satisfaction.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Arlington’s wish to be again employed in public
affairs was not gratified till 1675, when he once more went on
a diplomatic mission to Holland, in company with the Earl of
Ossory. Lady Arlington and Lady Ossory were sisters, and
members of the house of Nassau. This was his last appearance
in public life. Burnet says that ‘Arlington entirely mistook
the character of William, Prince of Orange,’ with whom
he had to deal, speaking to him in a dictatorial manner,
which was not at all agreeable to that Prince, although he was
then young in years. Arlington still held a place in the Royal
household, but he had fallen into disgrace, and the King
encouraged and enjoyed any jest, or ridicule, at the expense
of his former boon companion. Nothing delighted Charles
more than to see some of his courtiers put a black patch upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>their noses, and strut about with a long white staff, in imitation
of ‘Harry Bennet.’</p>

<p class='c035'>James <span class='fss'>II.</span> did not remove him from his post in the household,
but he only survived the new accession a few months,
dying in July 1685.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Arlington was buried at Euston, in Suffolk; his wife
was the daughter of Lewis de Nassau, Count of Beverwoort
and Auverquerque (a natural son of Maurice of Nassau, Prince
of Orange), by Elizabeth, Countess Horn. She had two
sisters, Mauritia, married to Colin, Earl of Balcarres, and
the second to the gallant Earl of Ossory. An only child was
born to Lord and Lady Arlington,—Isabella, who married in
1672 Henry Fitzroy, natural son of Barbara Villiers, Duchess
of Cleveland, afterwards created Earl of Euston and Duke
of Grafton.</p>

THE family of Wharton derive the name from
a ‘fair lordship’ on the river Eden, county
Westmoreland.</p>

<p class='c035'>Grainger, in speaking of this picture in
the Wrest collection, says of Lord Wharton
that he was in the service of the Parliament
during the civil war in the reign of Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span>, but that
courage was undoubtedly not his shining point. ‘Like his
grandson Duke Wharton, he could better exercise his tongue
than his sword.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Walker says of him, that at the battle of Edgehill, where
he was the colonel of a regiment of Roundheads, his Lordship
was found hidden in a ditch, but we are bound to take such
testimonies <i>cum grano</i>. He was the fourth Baron, of decidedly
puritanical views, and, whether a good soldier or not, he was
constantly with the army, and his political life was an eventful
one. He sat in Parliament for many years, and was summoned
to attend the treaty of Ripon, together with several
other Peers, among those who were the least obnoxious at
that time to the popular party. Lord Wharton was also one
of the so-called Commissioners who went to Edinburgh at the
meeting of the Scotch Parliament. After the Restoration he
was sent to the Tower, together with the Duke of Buckingham
and Lords Salisbury and Shaftesbury, ‘charged with contempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>of the authority, and being, of Parliament,’ for having called in
question the Parliament meeting after a very long prorogation.
In this case the Duke of Buckingham petitioned the King,
and the captive Peers were soon set at liberty, with the
exception of Lord Shaftesbury. But Lord Wharton’s chief
characteristic seems to have been his high esteem of the
matrimonial state, since he married three times. His first
wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Richard Wandesford,
Knight, in the county of York, by whom he had an only
daughter, married to Robert Bertie, Lord Willoughby
d’Eresby, afterwards Earl of Lindsay. His second wife
was Jane, daughter and heir to Arthur Goodwin, upper
Winchenden, county Bucks, by whom he had six children.
His third spouse was the daughter of William
Carre, Groom of the Bedchamber to James <span class='fss'>I.</span>, who was
widow of Edward Popham. By her he had one son, William,
killed in a duel.</p>

Colonel Whalley to give Mistress Kirke a

HE was the son of Diego Mesia de Obando,
by Elizabeth, daughter of the Count
D’Olvares. From early youth he showed
an aptitude for military and diplomatic
affairs; and in 1626 he was created Marquez
de Leganes, and sent by Philip <span class='fss'>IV.</span> in command
of the Spanish forces in the Netherlands; and the
ensuing year the King further employed him in negotiations
respecting the proposed annexation to Spain of some of the
disputed Provinces. Leganes was a companion in arms of
the celebrated Cardinal Infant, Ferdinand, son of Philip <span class='fss'>III.</span>,
by whose side he fought at Nordlingen, and contributed not
a little to that decisive victory gained by the Imperialists over
the Swedes and Duke Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. It was in
allusion to this battle that the pious Canon Antonio Calderon,
in his funeral oration on the Cardinal, after extolling the
virtues and valour of this warlike prelate, reminded his
hearers that Nordlingen was the place ‘where the heretic
Luther preached his most pestilential doctrines.’ On the
death of the Archduchess Clara Eugenia, Ferdinand succeeded
to the Government of the Spanish Netherlands, and
thither Leganes followed him, but was summoned to Milan
in 1636, on his appointment as Governor of that city.
Northern Italy was at that time the theatre of constant warfare,
and Leganes distinguished himself in frequent encounters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>with the French, the Piedmontese, and the Savoyards. The
Valteline especially was torn by internal discord, the result of
religious differences between the Protestants and the Catholics;
while the position of the country made it an object of desire
and contention among foreign powers. Leganes had his
hands full in that direction, both as regarded military operations
and negotiations with the French, who disputed the
territory. On the death of the Duke of Savoy, the Emperor
Ferdinand employed the Milanese Governor to oppose the
election of the widowed Duchess as Regent for her son’s
dominions; after which Leganes invaded Piedmont, took
Vercelli, Asti, Crescentine, and some smaller towns; marched
on Turin, where he was unsuccessful; and then attacked
Casale, a stronghold of much importance, where he was
beaten back with great loss by the French, under Comte
Simon d’Harcourt. This failure was a source of terrible
mortification to the Spanish General; but the future had consolation
in store for him. His Italian campaign at an end;
he marched into Catalonia, and there had his revenge on his
old enemies, and the Comte d’Harcourt himself, by wresting
from them the town of Lerida, which had been some time in
the occupation of the French. While thus engaged in active
service, intrigues were being carried on at the Court of Spain
against Leganes, and imputations were cast on his military
conduct, from which he had great difficulty in defending himself.
In spite, however, of the machinations of his enemies,
he was named Generalissimo of the Forces, and despatched
against the Portuguese in 1646. His death took place in
1655. He had to wife Philippina, daughter of the famous
commander, Ambrogio Spinola, who had done such gallant
service for the Spaniards in the Netherlands and elsewhere.
In the wars of Northern Italy he had been less successful;
and the mortification he experienced from several discomfitures,
combined with the slights put upon him by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>reigning King of Spain, from whose predecessor he had
received the highest marks of favour, was said to have
accelerated the death of the great commander.</p>

<p class='c035'>In the collection of the engraved portraits by Vandyck
there is a spirited likeness of the Marquis de Leganes, with a
Latin inscription enumerating his many titles. In addition
to those already mentioned, he was Lord of the Bedchamber
to the King of Spain, Grand Commander of the Order of the
Lion, Privy Councillor of State and War, President of the
Council in Flanders, and Captain-General of Artillery.</p>

SHE was the daughter of John Vernon of
Hodnet, county Salop, and married Henry
Wriothesley, third Earl of Southampton,
brother in arms of Robert, Earl of Essex,
under whom he served in his foreign campaigns;
and in one engagement in which he
had distinguished himself, Lord Southampton was knighted
by his general’s hand on the field, ‘before he could sheathe
his sword, or wipe the sweat from his brow.’ His adhesion to
Lord Essex, when that nobleman fell under her Majesty’s displeasure,
nearly cost Lord Southampton his life; but he was
more prudent than his friend, for he made submission, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>asked mercy of Elizabeth, while Essex, who disdained to follow
a similar course in his own case, interceded with the Queen
for his former comrade. Southampton’s life was spared; but
he was kept a close prisoner in the Tower till the accession of
King James, when he was set at liberty.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Southampton had two sons, the eldest of whom
accompanied him to the Low Countries on military service,
where they were both attacked by fever. Young Lord
Wriothesley died, to the inexpressible grief of his father, who,
travelling home with the loved remains ere he was fit to move,
was delayed by a relapse, and expired at Bergen-op-Zoom.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Southampton survived her Lord many years. We
hear of her, 1647, giving shelter to King Charles on his
escape from Hampton Court. She was staying at her son’s
country house, at Titchfield, in Hampshire, where the King,
who was riding for his life, thought best to take refuge, while
he sent messengers to Portsmouth to inquire for a ship that
ought to have been in waiting there, but which failed him.
Lord Southampton, a zealous loyalist, and devoted personal
friend of Charles’s, was absent from home, but his mother, the
aged Countess, was a woman of courage and fidelity, and as
deeply attached to the Royal cause as her son. To her the
King felt no hesitation in declaring himself, and claiming her
protection; and in that safe custody he remained several days,
before proceeding to the Isle of Wight, where he was retaken
by the rebels.</p>

BOTH killed in action, within a few years of
each other. Esmé Stuart, Duke of Richmond
and Lennox, had seven sons, all of whom he
survived, and, on his death, the title merging
in the person of his Royal kinsman,
Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>, his Majesty bestowed it on his
natural son, by Louise de la Querquaille, Duchess of Portsmouth,
ancestor of the present Duke.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord John Stuart was the eldest son of Duke Esmé.
Grainger, in his description of the portrait in question, speaks
most highly of his noble disposition and courage, which ‘he
carried indeed to rashness.’ A devoted loyalist, at the battle
of Cheriton Down he was charging up-hill in command of a
troop of light horse to attack Sir William Waller’s army, when
he fell into an ambuscade, having had two horses killed under
him. He lay, pierced by innumerable wounds, amidst hundreds
of his own men; he was, however, carried off the field
while still living (as was Sir John Smith, brother to Lord
Carrington), and conveyed first to Reading, and the next day
still further on the road, in order to be within help of skilful
surgeons. But the gallant youth did not survive the second
dressing of his wounds. He was buried at Christchurch,
Oxford, as was a younger brother, killed at the battle of Edgehill.
Lord Clarendon, speaking of Lord John, says that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>was early bent on a military career, being ‘of a tough and
choleric disposition,’ and caring little for the ‘softnesses of
social life.’ Yet he must have been of a loveable nature, for
his death was deeply regretted. Lord Bernard was the
youngest son of Duke Esmé. He commanded the gallant
troop known as the King’s Bodyguard, consisting of the most
eminent Royalists in both Houses of Parliament, and, indeed,
in all England. Their servants formed another troop under
Sir William Killigrew, and invariably followed their lords and
masters to the field. At the battle of Cropedy Bridge, where
the King commanded in person, Lord Bernard secured the
safety of his Majesty, who was in imminent peril, by charging
two bodies of the Roundhead horse, and bearing the brunt of
the enemy’s cannon, by remaining stationary in an open field,
to cover the free passage of the King. He also distinguished
himself greatly at the battle of Naseby, among other engagements,
and in consideration of his services was created Earl
of Lichfield, an honour he did not long enjoy. He was
killed at the battle of Rowton Heath, near Chester, having
once more come to the assistance of his Royal master and
kinsman. Young Lord Lichfield was deeply regretted. The
Duke of Richmond’s seven gallant sons all served in the
King’s army, and three of them died, like gallant Cavaliers, on
the field of battle.</p>

HE was born at Marlborough, in Wiltshire, but
went to London, where his father resided,
when quite young; and, being of a delicate
constitution, received his education at private
schools. He showed an early predilection
for the gentle arts of poetry, music, and
drawing, yet, when he came to man’s estate, these tastes, which
never left him, did not prevent his filling the posts he held
under Government with credit, and proving himself a good
man of business. He had an appointment in the Ordnance
Office, and was secretary to several Commissions for the
purchase of lands for the better securing of the Royal Docks
and Yards of Portsmouth, Chatham, and Harwich. He
found leisure in the midst of his public duties to devote a
considerable time to the acquisition of modern languages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>with which he supplemented his previous knowledge of Greek
and Latin. His first poetic effusion was inspired by the
Treaty of Ryswick, and was very popular. He wrote many
translations and imitations of classical authors, together with
such productions as ‘The Court of Neptune,’—an ode on the
return of King William from Holland; and many monodies,
elegies, and panegyrics, chiefly in honour of royal personages,
which would now be considered but dreary reading. For all
that he was much esteemed by the literati of the time, being
intimate with Addison, Pope, Rowe, etc.; and Johnson tells
us that Addison consulted with him, and even at one time
asked his co-operation, in the matter of his tragedy of Cato,
which, it appears, was finished, and put on the stage at the
instigation of John Hughes. He was also much favoured by
men of high standing and position, and when Lord Wharton
was made Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, he offered our author
an appointment in the sister country. Hughes declined,
although at the time in very poor circumstances; but he had
another true friend and patron,—the Lord Chancellor Cowper,
in whose family he had been tutor. Lord Cowper not only
made Hughes secretary for the Commission of the Peace, but,
on his own removal from office, recommended him to the
notice of his successor. Hughes was now in comparatively
affluent circumstances, but his failing health prevented his
enjoyment of life. He had consumptive tendencies, and grew
gradually weaker. His last work was a drama entitled ‘The
Siege of Damascus,’ which set the fashion of sieges innumerable.
He completed it a short time before his death, with a
dedication to Lord Cowper; but he had no strength to attend
the rehearsals, or energy to resist the emendations, alterations,
and innovations thrust upon him by the worshipful company
of players. The first night of his tragedy’s representation
was the last of the author’s life; they brought him word that
‘The Siege’ was progressing satisfactorily; but by that time his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>thoughts were fixed on the new life which was opening before
him, and he made no remark, but passed silently away. Many
of his works were published during his life; many more after
his death. He was a constant contributor to the <i>Spectator</i>, the
<i>Guardian</i>, and similar periodicals; and Steele wrote an
eulogistic paper on his death. Two letters which passed
between Swift and Pope may perhaps help to enable us (if
we accept their testimony) in assigning Hughes a place as an
author. The Dean writes: ‘A month ago a friend sent me
over the works of John Hughes in prose and verse. I never
heard of the man in my life, yet I find your name as a
subscriber. He is far too grave a poet for me, and I think
among the mediocrists in prose, as well as verse.’ Pope
replies: ‘To answer your question about Hughes: what he
wanted in genius he made up in honesty; but he was of the
class you think him.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Only a few weeks before his death he sent Lord Cowper

SHE was the daughter of Sir Samuel Holled,
Knight, merchant of London, wife of Sir
William Cowper, second baronet, and
mother of the Lord Chancellor. She was
an eccentric woman, ill favoured and
ill tempered, in constant collision with her
husband, her sons, and her servants,—in fact, to a certain extent,
the terror of the household. She wrote a voluminous diary,
still in the possession of her descendant, the present Lord
Cowper,—a strange mixture of pious reflections, together
with anecdotes more remarkable for breadth than point.
Towards the end of her life she became more placable in
disposition. She had two sons,—William, the first Earl, and
Spencer, the celebrated judge.</p>

THE subject of this notice derived his origin
from one ‘Walter,’ a knight who flourished
in the year 1179. He was one of the seven
imperial vassals of Guelderland, who exercised
sovereign rights, each in his several
domain.</p>

<p class='c035'>Surnames were not known in the middle of the twelfth
century. Walter Van Keppel was probably among the first
who made the addition to his baptismal appellation. Towards
the close of the century it became customary for each knight
to call himself after the spot of ground on which his principal
castle was situated. Accordingly, our Walter assumed the
name of an islet on the river Issel, on which he created his
Hoofdslot, which Hoofdslot is now occupied by the descendants
of a female branch of the family. Passing over a long
line of ancestors, we arrive at Oswald Van Keppel, Lord of
the Voorst, who (the genealogists show) bore sixteen quarterings
of nobility on his escutcheon. Oswald dying in 1685,
his son, Arnold (whose portrait is under consideration) succeeded
to the lordship of Voorst. He was now thirteen
years of age, Page of Honour to William of Orange, Stadtholder,
and the youngest, liveliest, and handsomest of the five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>Dutch noblemen who landed with their illustrious countryman
at Torbay on the memorable 5th of November 1688.
On his accession to the English throne, William <span class='fss'>III.</span> raised
his page to the confidential post of amanuensis, and from that
time never slackened in his partiality and friendship. In
1695, on Keppel’s attaining his majority, he was created Earl
of Albemarle, Viscount Bury, and Baron Ashford, and, shortly
afterwards, Knight of the Garter. Mackay, in his <i>Characters</i>,
describes the new Peer as ‘King William’s constant companion
in all his diversions and pleasures,’ and as being after a time
intrusted with affairs of the greatest importance. He was
beautiful in person, open and free in conversation, and very
expensive in his manner of living. ‘About this time,’ says
Bishop Burnet, ‘the King set up a new favourite, Keppel, a
gentleman of Guelder, who was raised from a page to the
highest degree of favour that any person had ever obtained
about the King. By a quick and unaccountable progress he
engrossed the Royal favour so entirely that he disposed of
everything in the King’s power. He was a cheerful young
man, that had the art to please, but was so much given to his
own pleasure, that he could scarce subject himself to the
attendance and drudgery that were necessary to maintain his
post; he had not, however, yet distinguished himself in
anything. He was not cold or dry, as the Earl of Portland
was thought to be, who seemed to have the art of creating
enemies to himself, and not one friend; but the Earl of Albemarle
had all the arts of Court, and was civil to all.’ If this
spoiled child of nature and fortune counted his Court duties
as drudgery, the same could not be said of his military avocations.
He studied the art of war under his Royal patron,
one of the most consummate captains of the day. So satisfied
was the teacher with the capacity of his pupil, that he
not only initiated him into the secrets of his strategy, but
imparted to him no small share in the execution of his projects,—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span> confidence which, although placed in so young a
man, the King never had reason to repent.</p>

<p class='c035'>In the year of his elevation to the Peerage, Albemarle
accompanied the King on the memorable campaign which
ended in the surrender of Namur to William <span class='fss'>III.</span>, who left his
friend behind for the transaction of some necessary business
in that town, whilst he proceeded to his Palace of the Loo,
before returning to England. Here the news of Albemarle’s
sudden and alarming illness so distressed the King that he
sent his own physician, the eminent Dr. John Radcliffe, to the
sufferer’s assistance. Albemarle soon recovered under the
good doctor’s skilful care; and so delighted was the King to
have his favourite restored to health, that he acknowledged
Radcliffe’s services in the most munificent manner. In addition
to his travelling expenses, the Doctor received £400 and
a magnificent diamond ring; Radcliffe was also offered a
baronetcy, but he declined, on the plea of having no son to
inherit the title. In 1698 Lord Albemarle received a grant
of 100,000 confiscated acres in Ireland, which grant, however
(as in the case of Lord Athlone and others), the Commons of
England very properly refused to ratify. The following year
the King sent some of the most skilful British artificers to
Holland to decorate and beautify the house and grounds of
the Voorst, at a cost of £50,000. What this large sum would
represent in these days, the writer does not feel competent to
hazard an opinion.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1701 Lord Albemarle married Gertrude, daughter of
Adam van der Duen, Lord of Gravemoor, whose descent is
traced by the genealogists of Guelderland to Alphert, ninth
Lord of Bridesden, and through him to Siegfried, son of
Arnulf, Count of Holland, who died in 999.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Treaty of Ryswick, in 1697, had procured for Europe
a few years’ suspension of hostilities; but in 1702 broke out
the Spanish War of Succession, when Albemarle was sent on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>a mission to Holland by Royal command, but was soon
recalled in hot haste to England to his dying master’s bedside.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘The King,’ says Macaulay, ‘was sinking fast.’ Albemarle
arrived at Kensington exhausted by hasty travel, and William
bade him rest for some hours. He then summoned him to
make his report. It was in all respects satisfactory: the States-General
were in the best temper; the troops, the provisions,
the magazines were all in good order; everything was in
readiness for an early campaign. William received the intelligence
with the calmness of a man whose work is done; he
was in no illusion as to his danger. ‘I am fast advancing,’
he said, ‘to my end.’</p>

<p class='c035'>To Albemarle he gave the keys of his closet and private
drawers. It was now about seven in the morning.
The Bishop knelt down and said the customary prayer: when
it was ended, the King was no more. By a codicil to the Royal
will, Albemarle came into possession of the lordship of the
Breevervoorst and 200,000 guelders.</p>

<p class='c035'>In June 1702 an heir was born to the house of Keppel,
who was named William, after the child’s patron, and Anne,
after the reigning sovereign, who stood godmother in person.
Shortly after the birth of this son, Lord Albemarle returned
to his native country, where he passed the greater part of his
time, and took his place as a member of the Assembly of the
States-General.</p>

<p class='c035'>We have not space to do more than glance at his military
career. Suffice it to say that he served with distinction successively
under four of the greatest commanders of their day,—William
<span class='fss'>III.</span>, Marshal Auverquerque, the Duke of Marlborough,
and Prince Eugène of Savoy; all of whom in turn
bore public testimony to his merits as a soldier.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1712 he was, on the recommendation of the Duke of
Marlborough, appointed to the command of the Dutch forces,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>and on the death of Queen Anne he was sent by the States-General
to congratulate George <span class='fss'>I.</span> on his accession to the
British throne. The new monarch, accompanied by his son,
the Duke of Gloucester (afterwards George <span class='fss'>II.</span>), was Lord
Albemarle’s guest at the Voorst on his first day’s journey
towards his new kingdom. In 1717 Albemarle was nominated
by the nobles of Holland to compliment Peter the
Great on his visit to their country, and he accompanied the
Czar in great state to the city, which his Imperial Majesty
had first entered as a journeyman carpenter! Arnold Keppel,
first Earl of Albemarle, died the following year, and was succeeded
by his son, William Anne, Viscount Bury. The portrait
of which we are now speaking is a replica of one in the
possession of the original’s great-great-grandson, the present
bearer of the title. There are several other likenesses in
England of this distinguished man, among which may be
noted one at Woburn Abbey, that came into the Russell
family in consequence of the marriage of Lady Elizabeth
Keppel (daughter of the second Earl of Albemarle) with the
Marquess of Tavistock in 1764.</p>

THE biographer of the second Duke thus
alludes to the antiquity of the family:—‘It
is sufficient for the honour of the house of
Ormonde that its original is too ancient to
be traced, and that its first descents, even
after it became considerable for its possession,
power, and alliances, cannot be ascertained.’</p>

<p class='c035'>According to the above-quoted author, the immediate
ancestor of the family, Theobald Walter, accompanied King
Henry <span class='fss'>II.</span> to Ireland about the year 1171, when Roderick,
King of Connaught, and many other petty Princes, yielded up
their sovereignty to the English monarch. Theobald Walter
did Henry good service in the new country, and received as a
reward such extensive grants of lands, as determined him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>take up his residence in Ireland; and from that time forth
the fortunes of the family have been bound up with those of
the sister island. The post of Chief Butler (hereditary) was
also assigned him, with a further grant of what was called ‘the
prisage of wine,’ which entitled Theobald and his descendants
to one tun of wine out of nine brought by any ship
into Irish ports. In 1315 Edmund le Botillier (it is an open
question if the name were derived from the office) was
created Earl of Carrick, as a recompense for his loyal services
to Edward <span class='fss'>II.</span> He was Guardian and Governor of the kingdom
of Ireland; and henceforth his descendants in the succeeding
reigns were almost invariably connected with the
government of that country, whether as Lords-Deputy,
Lords-Justices, or Lords-Lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Carrick’s son married the King’s cousin, and was in
1322 created Earl of Ormonde. He had also the rights of a
Palatine in the county of Tipperary conferred on him,—rights
which were taken away and restored again and again in the
troubled times of that ever troubled country. Few families
in any part of the world have been more remarkable for the
vicissitudes of fortune than the Butlers. The seventh Earl
of Ormonde died without sons, and left his two daughters
very large fortunes; the youngest married Sir William Boleyn,
and was grandmother to Queen Anne of that name.</p>

<p class='c035'>Sir Piers Butler, a distant relative, became heir to the Irish
estates, but King Henry <span class='fss'>VIII.</span>, at the instigation of his father-in-law,
Sir Thomas Boleyn, prevailed upon him (chiefly, it is
said, by conferring on him the title of Ossory) to relinquish the
earldom of Ormonde in favour of the said Sir Thomas, on
whose death, however, a few years afterwards, the rightful
Earl of Ormonde resumed his title. We are induced to give
these details in consequence of the strange coincidences which
befell the heads of this family in different reigns.</p>

<p class='c035'>Thomas, the tenth Earl, a man of undaunted courage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>who began his military career at an early age, was a great
favourite with Queen Elizabeth, and for a time with King
James <span class='fss'>I.</span> ‘His courage in the field and his spirit in private
occurrences were remarkable. He always held the Earl of
Leicester at defiance, and did not scruple to charge him to
the Queen as a knave and coward.’ There is an amusing
anecdote told of the two noblemen meeting one day at Court,
in the antechamber. After the usual exchange of civilities,
says Lord Leicester, ‘My Lord Ormonde, I dreamed of you
last night.’ ‘What could you dream of me?’ inquired the
other. ‘That I gave you a box on the ear,’ was the rejoinder.
‘Oh,’ exclaimed Lord Ormonde; ‘do you not know that
dreams are always interpreted by contraries?’ and with that
he bestowed a hearty cuff on the Royal favourite. This one-sided
satisfaction entailed on Ormonde a visit to the Tower;
but he was soon released. The Queen had a great fancy for
him, in spite of Lord Leicester’s enmity, and used to call him
her ‘black husband.’ His dark complexion had gained for him
in Ireland the nickname of ‘Dhuiv,’ or ‘the Black.’ He was
three times married: first to Elizabeth, daughter and heiress
to Thomas, Lord Berkeley; secondly to Elizabeth, daughter
of Lord Sheffield; and thirdly to Ellen, daughter of Lord
Barry and widow of Lord Poer, whom he married when he
was old and blind. He had children by his second wife only,—a
son, who died in boyhood, and a daughter, Elizabeth.
This young lady married, by her father’s wish, her cousin,
Lord Tulleophelim, who died very shortly afterwards without
children. King James <span class='fss'>I.</span> obliged the aged Earl of Ormonde,
much against his will, to bestow the hand of his widowed
daughter on one of his own Scotch favourites, Sir Richard
Preston, whom he first created Baron Dingwall, and afterwards,
in (what his Majesty was pleased to call) right of his wife,
Earl of Desmond, an act which caused universal dissatisfaction
in Ireland,—so time-honoured a title to be bestowed on an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>alien. Not content with this deed of injustice, James ordained
that Preston should become possessed of the bulk of the
Irish property which Thomas, Earl of Ormonde, had bequeathed
to his successors in the title. At his death in 1614,
the King used every endeavour to persuade Sir Walter Butler
(who became eleventh Earl) to yield up his rights in favour of
Lord Desmond, but, with the true spirit of his race, he showed
a bold front to the tyrant, in consequence of which he was
thrown into the Fleet prison, where he remained in captivity
for eight years. His eldest son, Lord Thurles, married
Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Poyntz, of Iron Acton,
county Gloucester, by whom he had James, first Duke of
Ormonde, and several other children.</p>

<p class='c035'>The subject of our notice was born in 1610 at Newcastle
House, in Clerkenwell, belonging to the Duke of that title,
but inhabited at the time by Lady Thurles’s father, Sir John
Poyntz. The infant was nursed by a carpenter’s wife at
Hatfield, and remained in her charge, when his parents
returned to Ireland, till he was three years old, when they
sent for him; and the Duke used in after years to relate
that he could call to mind, even at that tender age, how he
had been carried in arms through the streets of Bristol, and
what he then noticed on the bridge. He appears to have
had a most retentive memory, for he also recollected being
taken to visit Thomas, the aged Earl of Ormonde, who was
living at his estate of Carrick-upon-Suir, and who felt a
great interest in the child, not only as his future heir, but
on account of his former friendship with Sir John Poyntz.
The Duke often spoke in his later life of the impression
his kinsman had made on him: a grand old man, with
sightless eyes and long white beard, wearing his George
round his neck, which he never laid aside, whether sitting in
his chair or lying on his bed. He would take the boy on his
knees and caress him, this last year of his life, for Earl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>Thomas died in 1614. James lived on in Ireland with his
father and mother, till the unfortunate death of the former,
who was drowned off the Skerries on his voyage to England
in 1619, <i>v.p.</i></p>

<p class='c035'>The little Lord Thurles accompanied his mother to
London the following year, and went to school at Finchley,
under a Roman Catholic priest, who educated him in his own
creed,—the actual Earl of Ormonde and all the younger
branches of the family adhering to the Church of Rome.
But Thurles was a ward of the Crown, and the King removed
him from Finchley, and transferred him to Lambeth Palace,
to be brought up as a Protestant, under Abbott, Archbishop
of Canterbury. The Primate troubled himself very little as
regarded the youth’s education, probably because he received
no allowance whatever, even for the maintenance of his pupil.
To the young Lord himself James only doled out the paltry
sum of forty pounds a year for all expenses. The biographer
of the second Duke, in alluding to these circumstances,
says that ‘intelligence found means to supply the want of
education.’ Even after his marriage Lord Thurles studied
Latin, from his uncle’s domestic chaplain, when on a visit
to Iron Acton. He also acquired a knowledge of the Irish
language, which he found of the greatest service to him
during his government, enabling him to communicate personally
with the Irish chiefs. He became, indeed, in every way
a most accomplished gentleman; his grandfather, the stout-hearted
Earl of Ormonde, had endured imprisonment and
hardship of all kinds rather than submit to the unjust
demands of the King, or surrender his lawful rights, but at
the expiration of eight years he was released, and a great
portion of his estates restored to him,—upon which he hired a
house in Drury Lane, and sent for his grandson from Lambeth
Palace to come and reside with him. Lord Thurles was
delighted with his emancipation from the dull atmosphere of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>the Primate’s roof. He mixed in all the gaieties of the town,
and took especial pleasure in theatrical representations and in
the society of the leading members of the profession. He
was also a frequent attendant at Court, by the express wish of
Lord Ormonde, who left him in London to make his way in
the world, while he returned to Ireland to look after the
property, which had been long neglected. The circumstances
attending the marriage and courtship of Lord Thurles
were of so romantic a nature, that we are induced to give
them in detail, although reluctant to record a stumble on the
threshold of so noble a career. It was at Court that he
first saw his cousin, Lady Elizabeth Preston, daughter to
Lord Dingwall and Desmond, already mentioned, by Lady
Elizabeth Butler. She was a ward of the King’s, who had
placed her under the care of Henry, Earl of Holland, who
held an office at Court. Though very young, she had a
perfect knowledge of all the family disputes, and had been
much influenced in Lord Thurles’s favour by the advice of her
kinsman, Lord Mountgarret, who not only highly commended
the young man, but pointed out to the heiress that their union
would be a means of reconciling all former difficulties. When
the cousins met at Court, Elizabeth ‘liked the person of the
young Lord, which was very handsome, his mien and manner
witty, insinuating; and the vivacity of his parts, with the
sprightly turn of his wit, made the conversation most pleasing
to her.’ This was remarked on, and the King admonished
Lord Thurles not to meddle with his ward. The secret of
this was that the Duke of Buckingham had arranged with
Lord Desmond that his nephew, Lord Feilding, should
espouse Lady Elizabeth Preston, with a remainder to their
heirs of her father’s titles. The said Earl of Desmond had
also received from the King the power over the wardship and
marriage of Lord Thurles, so that there seemed but little hope
of the union on which the cousins had set their hearts. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>Elizabeth had the spirit of her race. Her affections were
irrevocably fixed, and she was in a humour to say with the
beautiful bride of Van Artevelde:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Me shall no earthly potentate or prince</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Toss, like a morsel of his broken meat,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To any suppliant: be they advised</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I am in wardship to the King of kings,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>God and my heart alone dispose of me.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>Now Lord Holland was inclined to further Lord Thurles’s
suit, actuated thereto, it was said, by pecuniary inducements;
but the Royal commands were not to be disobeyed, openly at
least. There was one in the house, however, who was in a
position to assist the lovers, and that was Lady Isabella Rich,
Lord Holland’s daughter, Elizabeth’s chosen friend, and sister
in all but name,—a lovely, sharp-witted girl of her own age.
She admitted Lord Thurles every day, at all hours, in a clandestine
manner; nor did her parents object or interfere, but
allowed her to make a feint of herself receiving the young
man’s addresses; and implicit trust was placed by all parties
in Isabella’s rectitude.</p>

<p class='c035'>Alas for the compact! which we must believe was begun
in good faith. Lord Thurles, as we have said, was young,
handsome, agreeable,—captivating, in fact, and the <i>rôle</i>
of confidante is proverbially dangerous. In an evil hour he
forgot his loyalty to his betrothed, and Isabella forgot her
friend, herself, her duty, and all but her infatuation for the
man who was playing a double part by the two girls. Few
romances can outdo this real history in sensational incident.
Lord Desmond was drowned about the same time as his wife
died, and the latter left as her last injunction that Elizabeth
should marry her cousin, and thus restore the property to the
rightful branch,—for Lady Desmond had never been easy in
her mind over these unlawful acquisitions. Buckingham was
assassinated, and King Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> gave the Royal consent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>the union of the cousins; ‘and so,’ says the biographer of the
great Duke of Ormonde (who, by the way, makes very light
of this episode), ‘the marriage was joyously celebrated, and
everybody content.’ We are not informed how the unfortunate
Lady Isabella fared on the occasion; her content could
not have been great; but the <i>dénouement</i> remains to be told,
and though, as a matter of dates, it should come much later,
we think it advisable to finish the concluding acts of the
drama in this place.</p>

<p class='c035'>Several years afterwards, when Lord Ormonde was in
Paris, he went to the Academy to visit a handsome and
intelligent youth, whom he had sent thither for his education;
whereupon he sat down, and wrote a long description of the
boy to Lady Isabella (then the wife of Sir James Thynne of
Longleat), being a subject in which they had a common
interest. As ill-luck would have it, he at the same time
indited a letter to his wife, and misdirected the covers. While
Lady Ormonde was making the discovery that she had been
cruelly deceived and betrayed by the two people she at that
time loved best in the world, Lady Isabella came in, and found
her reading the fatal letter.</p>

<p class='c035'>Tears, sobs, caresses—an agitating scene—ensued.  Isabella
humbled herself before the woman she had so grievously
injured, and sought by every means of fascination that she
possessed, to soften her just resentment. Lady Ormonde,
generous and high-minded, almost beyond belief, raised the
suppliant, who was kneeling at her feet, with the promise not
only of forgiveness, but of unchanging friendship,—a promise
nobly kept, as we shall see later. Scarcely more marvellous
is the fact, for we cannot doubt the evidence, that Lady
Ormonde not only never upbraided her husband, but from
that day kept a profound silence on the subject. Nor was
this all. Some time afterwards, when Lady Ormonde was
residing with her children at Caen, she received a letter from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>Lady Isabella, who had again got herself into hot water, recalling
her promise of unchanging friendship, and asking for
shelter. The generous-hearted exile not only welcomed her
old companion to share her small house and straitened
means, but allowed her to remain for nearly two years
under her roof, during which time Lord Ormonde was a
constant visitor. The destinies of the two women, who
had been early friends, but whose characters were diametrically
opposed, were strangely entangled,—Lady Isabella, being
described in a contemporary journal as ‘one of those
rattle-brained ladies,’ was most eccentric, to say the least
of it, and full of ‘strange vagaries;’ while Lady Ormonde
was remarkable for sound sense and judgment, and for
her dignified and stately deportment. We make an extract
bearing on this subject from the Life of Roger Boyle, Lord
Broghill, afterwards Earl of Orrery. This nobleman, who,
like his father and his brothers, was a zealous Royalist, was
surprised one day at receiving a summons from the Protector,
who bluntly offered him a high command in the army in
Ireland under Government. Broghill gave for answer that
nothing should induce him to take arms against the King, his
master. ‘No one asked you to do so,’ was the angry retort;
‘I offer you the alternative of serving England against the
Irish insurgents, or proceeding without delay to the Tower of
London.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The first choice was the most palatable, and Broghill returned
to Ireland, where he continued to give proofs of his
courage and martial skill. Between him and Lord Ormonde
there had been some disagreement, but they were reconciled,
and Broghill ever afterwards remained the fast friend of both
husband and wife, and, standing high in the Protector’s favour,
in consequence of his military services, more than one opportunity
presented itself of being useful to them. He had come
over from Ireland, when the Protector sent for him, and thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>addressed him: ‘If you are still interested in my Lord
Ormonde’s safety, you had better advise him to leave London.
We know all about him, where he is, what he is doing, and he
had best absent himself.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The hint was given and taken, and Lord Ormonde left
England accordingly. A short time elapsed, when one day
Lady Ormonde was much distressed at receiving a domiciliary
visit from one of Cromwell’s functionaries, who ransacked
the house, and carried away every paper he could find.
She immediately sent for her faithful friend, and besought
him to intercede once more in her behalf. Broghill lost no
time; he hurried off to Whitehall, and found the autocrat in
a towering passion. ‘You have undertaken, indeed,’ he said,
‘for the quietness of a fine person. I have allowed my Lady
Ormonde £2000 a year out of her husband’s estates, because
they were sufferers in Ireland. But I find she is a wicked
woman, and I promise you she shall pay for it.’ It was
some time before Lord Broghill could gain a hearing,
but when he was permitted to speak, he asked what proof
could be adduced of Lady Ormonde’s guilt, upon which
Cromwell threw him a letter, that certainly left no doubt
of the writer’s Royalist tendencies and disaffection to the
existing Government. ‘This was found,’ said the Protector,
‘in searching the escritoire at Lord Ormonde’s house.’
Lord Broghill could not help laughing. ‘But this,’ he
observed, ‘is not the writing of my Lady Ormonde.’ ‘Indeed,’
rejoined Cromwell angrily, ‘and pray who wrote these lines?’
Bent on saving his friends, Lord Broghill not only explained
the letter was from Lady Isabella Thynne (between whom
and Lord Ormonde there had been undoubted love passages),
but he produced some other letters from the same lady to
identify the handwriting, and further proceeded to relate
several anecdotes of a most lively nature respecting her,
which turned all Cromwell’s wrath into merriment, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>laughed immoderately. Broghill’s judicious conduct had
gained his friends’ cause.</p>

<p class='c035'>We have forestalled events in order to finish the romance
of which Lady Isabella Thynne was the heroine, and we
must now turn back to the year 1629, being that of the
marriage. Lord Thurles took his bride to the house of his
maternal uncle, in Gloucestershire, where they remained a
year, and then proceeded to Carrick, in Ireland, where his
grandfather lived, and where he began his military career by
purchasing a troop of horse. He went to Scotland, and then
to England, and succeeding to the title of Ormonde on Earl
Walter’s death, returned to Ireland in 1633. There he
began a life of activity, which never ceased from that time
forward. Many passages in Carte’s Life of the ‘great Duke’
tend to confirm our previous remark, that Irish history, more
than that of any other nation, verifies the saying, ‘Que
l’histoire se répète.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Great were the expectations raised all over the kingdom,
in 1623, of important matters to be done on the coming over
of a new Lord-Deputy, endowed with a larger measure of
authority, etc. This was Lord Wentworth, who arrived in
Dublin in July 1633. Lord Ormonde did not delay to
repair thither, in order to pay his respects to my Lord Wentworth,
who, chancing to observe him from a window, as he
was crossing the Castle-yard, observed to the standers-by,
‘If I possess any skill in physiognomy, that young man will
be the chief of his family.’</p>

<p class='c035'>At the outset of their acquaintance, an incident occurred
which threatened to make a breach between these two high
spirits, but, instead thereof, cemented a friendship, which was
only terminated by the untimely death of Lord Strafford.
During the session of the Irish Parliament, the Lord-Deputy
had found it advisable to prohibit the Lords wearing their
swords, lest, in the heat of argument, they might have recourse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>to sharper weapons than those of eloquence. The order was
obeyed in every instance, save that of my Lord Ormonde,
who, when the Usher of the Black Rod insisted on his disarming,
replied angrily, marching on in a stately manner, and
taking his seat in the House, ‘You shall have no sword of mine,
except through your body.’ On being summoned before the
Lord-Deputy for this open act of insubordination, he proudly
drew forth the King’s warrant for his admission to the Privy
Council. The Lord-Deputy was satisfied, and the two
noblemen became fast friends. When evil days fell on
Strafford, and the Irish Parliament joined the English in
hastening his downfall, Lord Ormonde pleaded his cause
in the Upper House with so much reason and eloquence
as to bias a considerable party in Strafford’s favour, at least
for a time. The letters which passed between them during
the latter’s imprisonment were couched in the most affectionate
terms. Writing from the Tower, the captive tells his
friend that he has recommended him to the King for the
Lord-Deputyship of Ireland; and later he writes: ‘There is so
little rest given to me, my noble Lord, that I have scarce time
to eat my bread. Your Lordship’s favours to me in my
afflictions are such as have and shall level my heart at your
foot so long as I live.’</p>

<p class='c035'>On the eve of his execution, Strafford intrusted Archbishop
Usher with some last requests to the King, amongst
which was the earnest hope that the Earl of Ormonde should
have his vacant Garter. The offer was made; but Lord
Ormonde declined, saying that his loyalty needed no such
stimulus, and that the honour might be more advantageously
bestowed for the King’s service.</p>

<p class='c035'>At the breaking out of the Irish rebellion, the King
wished to appoint him Lord-Deputy, but was overruled
by the Parliament, which had resolved on Lord Leicester.
He was however selected by the Lords-Justices in Ireland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>for the chief command of the forces in that country.
The appointment was an excellent one. He was successful
against the rebels for a considerable period, and
his services were (for a time) duly appreciated by the English
Commons, who voted a large sum of money to purchase him
a jewel of great value. They also recommended him to the
King for the Garter, an honour that was bestowed later on a
most deserving knight. Ormonde was indeed as chivalrous
as he was brave, keeping good faith with his savage adversaries;
and a noble answer given by him is worthy to be
recorded here. One of the native chiefs threatened to take
reprisals on Lady Ormonde and his family. ‘My wife and
dear ones,’ said the General, ‘are in your power; but for myself,
I should never be dastardly enough to revenge any offence
they received on the women and children of my enemies.’</p>

<p class='c035'>After a while his popularity began to wane, and he became
a mark for jealousy and calumny on both sides of St.
George’s Channel. The Lords-Justices thwarted him in his
campaigns, and stinted him in supplies, and the Lord-Deputy
Leicester never let slip an opportunity of doing him
an evil turn, both in public and private. The King, however,
remained his staunch friend, and wrote him a most flattering
letter, renewing his command of the army, and raising him to
the grade of a Marquis. The account of the Irish rebellion
would, and indeed has, filled many a large volume, and concerns
history rather than biography. We cannot do more
than glance at events, in which Lord Ormonde himself bore
so distinguished a part. After giving the most striking proofs
of valour, patriotism, and loyalty in his encounters with the
insurgents, under difficulties of almost unparalleled hardship,
want of supplies, provisions, and the like, he found himself
compelled to agree to a cessation of arms for twelve months.
The news of this treaty was received with much disapprobation
in England, and was represented by the enemies of Ormonde
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>and of the King, as ‘an unseasonable and unnecessary concession;’
but Charles was duly impressed with the honour and
ability of his faithful servant, and resolved to make him Lord-Lieutenant
in the stead of Lord Leicester. The gallant
General was unwilling to accept the post, but was persuaded
to do so, ‘without much hope, indeed, of serving the Crown,
or remedying many of the disorders.’</p>

<p class='c035'>During his tenure of office, political and religious factions
were at their height in this most unhappy country, and
intrigues on both sides of St. George’s Channel were carried
on against the Lord-Lieutenant, paralysing his efforts, till he
had no choice but to conclude a peace,—a peace that was
no peace. Conspiracies of all kinds were hatched,—and one in
particular was discovered, the aim of which was to seize the
person of Lord Ormonde in his own castle of Kilkenny,
whence he escaped with much difficulty to Dublin, where he
was besieged by the insurgents. He held out till all his supplies
were exhausted, and he had lost every hope of redress. The
King was a prisoner in the hands of the Roundheads, who had
sent over Commissioners to Ireland; there was no choice left
for Ormonde but to surrender to the Irish, or English rebels.
He chose the latter alternative, and, delivering up the keys to the
Commissioners, embarked for England, followed by the prayers
and good wishes of the well-affected among the citizens, but
more especially of the poorer clergy, whose wives and children
had been saved from starvation by his bounty and that of his
excellent wife. He reached England, went first to Iron Acton,
gained a pass from General Fairfax which gave him access
to the King (then a prisoner in his own palace of Hampton
Court), and hired a lodging at Kingston-on-Thames, in order
to remain in the vicinity. He had frequent intercourse with
his Royal master, who fully appreciated all his devoted friend
and subject had dared and done for his service, and reiterated
his opinion that no one else was qualified to fill the post of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>Viceroy of Ireland. But this view of the case did not fall in
with the notions of those in authority, and Ormonde received
intimation to the effect that it would be advisable for him to
leave England, which he accordingly did, and, crossing to
Dieppe, proceeded to Paris, to join the Queen, Henrietta
Maria, and the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p class='c035'>While residing in the French capital, Lord Ormonde kept
up a continuous correspondence with the loyalists in Scotland,
and more especially with the influential leaders in Ireland.
There had existed a feud between the Lords Ormonde and
Inchiquin and Lord Broghill, General of the Horse, but it
was not difficult to bring about a reconciliation between three
devoted servants of the Crown. Lord Ormonde was at length
prevailed on by the wishes of the Queen and Prince, as also
by the earnest solicitations of the Royalists in Ireland, to
return to that country, and resume his post as Lord-Lieutenant.
He had, during his stay in Paris, entered into communication
with many leading members of the Roman Catholic religion,
with a view to a pacification between the two opposing creeds
on his return, and had also endeavoured to raise at the French
Court a sufficient sum to insure him proper supplies; but in
this respect he was wofully disappointed, and he landed in
Cork with the miserable sum of thirty French pistoles in his
military chest.</p>

<p class='c035'>Everything was against him in Dublin,—the hands of the
Parliamentarians, Cromwell’s emissaries spread far and wide
over the country, while Prince Rupert, who commanded a
Royalist fleet on the coast, was less assistance than detriment
to the cause, from his unceasing jealousy and rivalry of
other officials. The news of the King’s execution was received
with consternation by his partisans in Scotland and Ireland,
and with profound grief by Lord Ormonde, who caused the
Prince of Wales to be instantly proclaimed, and wrote off to
him urging the advisability of his coming over in person,—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>scheme which was not carried out. The Lord-Lieutenant
was now engaged in negotiations of a pacific nature with the
so-called ‘old Irish party’ (headed by Phelim O’Neill, and
other leading Roman Catholics), and he concentrated all his
energies on gaining possession of Dublin. But the death of
O’Neill, the arrival of Cromwell with a large body of troops,
and the number of desertions, all conduced to render his
position untenable. He only waited for the King’s sanction
to leave Ireland, and once more embarked for France, where,
after a most tempestuous voyage, he joined his wife and
children at Caen, and passed many months between that
temporary home and Paris, where he finally joined the king,
as a regular attendant, after Charles’s escape from the battle
of Worcester.</p>

<p class='c035'>Ormonde was now reduced to the greatest straits, having
but one pistole a week for his board, and being obliged ‘to
go afoot, which is not considered reputable in Paris;’ added
to which, his wife found it impossible to live on at Caen, even
in the modest style to which she had lately been accustomed;
and the King had nothing to spare out of his scanty pittance
to assist his friends. In these trying circumstances, it was
arranged that Lady Ormonde should go to England in person,
and endeavour to gain some redress from Parliament. It was
no agreeable errand, but the lady was well qualified to act with
spirit and determination, tempered by tact; and she did not
shrink from the undertaking.</p>

<p class='c035'>Her dignity of demeanour and her courage were proverbial.
It had been said of her that she had the spirit of old Earl
Thomas; and she knew how to inspire Cromwell with respect.
In her interviews he always treated her with the greatest consideration,
and accompanied her downstairs to her coach or
chair, although she was kept long in suspense about her
financial demands, and the great man often answered her
arguments by a shrug of the shoulders. It may not come into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>the proper place, as far as dates are concerned, but, speaking
of her relations with the Protector, we must allude to an
audience she had of him later. Cromwell was very jealous of
the growing power and popularity of Lord Ossory, and although
he had already granted him a pass to travel beyond
seas, he suddenly thought it safer to have him seized, and sent
to the Tower. His mother immediately proceeded to Whitehall,
or wherever Cromwell was holding his reception at
the time, and asked her son’s freedom, saying she knew not
who were his accusers, or of what crime they accused him,
but that she would answer with her life for her son’s innocence.
Cromwell begged to be excused giving her an answer, but
observed he had much more reason to be afraid of her than
of anybody else.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘I desire no favour,’ said the noble petitioner aloud, before
the hundreds who were present on the occasion, ‘but do
consider it strange that I, who have never been implicated in
any plot, and never said a word against the Protector, should
be considered so terrible a person!’</p>

<p class='c035'>‘No, madam, that is not exactly the case,’ replied Oliver;
‘but your worth has gained you so great an influence over all
the commanders of our party, and we know so well your power
over the other side, that it is in your Ladyship’s breast to act
what you please.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The incident speaks well for both parties, and Oliver, with
all his faults, had learned to respect a noble woman when he
encountered one, being blest as he was in his wife and mother.
After many delays and heartburnings, the Parliament authorised
Lady Ormonde to receive from the Irish Commissioners
a yearly income for herself and children of £2000 out of her
own inheritance, together with the house of Donnemore, near
Kilkenny, for their residence.</p>

<p class='c035'>Here she took up her abode, and never saw her Lord
again till the Restoration. The treaty which was concluded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>between the Protector and the Court of France rendered it
imperative on the English King to leave Paris, and, accordingly,
accompanied by Ormonde, he proceeded to Spa (to
meet his sister, the Princess of Orange), and afterwards to
Aix-la-Chapelle and Cologne.</p>

<p class='c035'>From the latter place he despatched Lord Ormonde to
Paris on an errand of trust and difficulty. The young Duke
of Gloucester had been sent to the French capital with a
hardly-wrung permission from Oliver to pursue his education
under the auspices of his mother, who had pledged her word
to the King not to tamper with the boy’s religion,—an oath
which Henrietta Maria evidently thought ‘more honoured in
the breach than the observance.’</p>

<p class='c035'>She accordingly separated the Duke from his Protestant
tutor, and placed him under the care of a Jesuit priest, where
she frequently visited him, and by alternate coaxing and
threatening strove to bring her child over to her own creed.
The boy stood firm, and declared he would never disobey
his father’s last injunctions, but the Queen’s menace of never
seeing his face again grieved his affectionate nature so much
as to injure his health. Ormonde arrived in Paris, armed
with the King’s authority to convey the Duke of Gloucester
to Cologne, but the necessary funds for travelling expenses
were not forthcoming, so the Duke went to reside for a time
in Paris with Lord Hatton, a firm Royalist and faithful Protestant.
Lord Ormonde was not one to be baffled in any
undertaking in which he was engaged: he pawned his Garter,
and the jewel which the Parliament had given him, to defray
the cost of the journey; and he set out with his young charge,
travelling for safety <i>via</i> Antwerp, where he was like to have
died of a fever. At length, however, he placed the youth
under the protection of the King, his brother, and they remained
together till the Restoration took them to England.</p>

<p class='c035'>So temperately and judiciously had Lord Ormonde conducted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>this affair, that the King was deeply grateful to him,
and he still kept a tolerable hold on the good graces of the
Queen, and was, indeed, afterwards instrumental in bringing
about a reconciliation between mother and son. He was now
employed in several diplomatic missions of importance, especially
with the Court of Spain, and he ventured into England,
at the risk of life and freedom, in order to communicate with
the Royalists at home. He landed on the coast of Essex in
disguise, and went to London, where he lay <i>perdu</i>, only
venturing out at nightfall, and running the gauntlet of many
dangers and adventures, which were not without some charm
for a man of his spirit.</p>

<p class='c035'>We cannot refrain from alluding to an incident, which,
though in reality trivial, has a laughable side, and there has
been little that is laughable to record in the life of Lord
Ormonde. He often changed his lodgings, and was constantly
reconnoitring the premises with a view to escape, changing
his clothes, generally lying down dressed. He had an aversion
to wearing a periwig, so a friend gave him a dye to turn
his own hair black, but the lotion was badly mixed, and the
ingredients deleterious, so that poor Lord Ormonde’s head
was not only scalded, but his hair came out in party-coloured
patches of every variegated hue, more likely to attract than
elude observation.</p>

<p class='c035'>He returned to Paris, having proved, what was already
undoubted, his courage and zeal to the King’s service, but
with no other good result. His presence in the French capital
was almost as dangerous as it had been in London, for Cromwell
had set a price upon his head, and the Cardinal Mazarin,
who was then Prime Minister, was by no means insensible to
the charms of money.</p>

<p class='c035'>The liberality of Lord Ormonde, even in his straitened
circumstances, had like on one occasion to have been productive
of unfortunate results, and the incident teaches a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>lesson of the necessity of studying the peculiar manners and
customs of foreign countries in contradistinction to our own.
Lord Ormonde was much respected and courted by the
French nobility, to one of whom he paid a visit near St.
Germains, and on his departure, according to the well-known
English fashion of ‘vails’ or parting gifts, he presented the
<i>maître d’hôtel</i> with ten pistoles, being the whole contents of
his purse.</p>

<p class='c035'>Riding onward, as we may imagine rather disconsolately,
the Marquis was startled by the sound of wheels driving
furiously; and, looking back, perceived his late host’s coach
gaining on him. He reined in his steed, sprang from the
saddle, and embraced his friend, who alighted at the same
moment. Lord Ormonde was surprised at a decided coldness
in the Frenchman’s manner and tone of voice, as he
said, ‘After you left the château, I heard a great disturbance
among the servants of my household, and, inquiring into the
cause, found them all quarrelling over their share of the money
which your Lordship, for some inexplicable motive, had given
to my <i>maître d’hôtel</i>. I am come to ask if you found any
fault with your treatment in my house?’</p>

<p class='c035'>‘On the contrary,’ warmly responded Lord Ormonde.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘Then why did you treat it as an inn? I pay my servants
well to wait on me and my guests. I do not know, my Lord,
if this be the custom in your country, but assuredly it is not so
with us. Here are the ten pistoles, which I have rescued from
my servants’ grasp; you must either take them back at my
hands, or else your Lordship must give me on the spot that
satisfaction which no gentleman can refuse another.’</p>

<p class='c035'>We may believe the affair turned into one of laughter
rather than of ‘honour,’ when Lord Ormonde explained that
in his country such amenities were invariably practised by
guests at leave-taking.</p>

<p class='c035'>The King of England was now at Brussels, hampered and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>entangled by fruitless negotiations with foreign powers, and
he sent for his right hand, Lord Ormonde.</p>

<p class='c035'>Short cuts are proverbially dangerous, and so thought the
Marquis, who, taking horse, rode from Paris, <i>via</i> Lyons and
Geneva, through the Palatinate to Brussels, where he joined
the King, who, failing in his Spanish views, had formed an
idea of marrying the daughter of Frederic Henry, the
Stadtholder. But the Dowager Princess of Orange, who was
very powerful at her son’s Court, opposed the design so
strongly that the match was prevented.</p>

<p class='c035'>Meanwhile Lord Ormonde’s eldest son, the Earl of Ossory,
fell in love with Emilia, daughter of Louis de Nassau, Lord
of Auverquerque, a natural son of Maurice, Prince of Orange.
Louis was much esteemed, both for character and position, and
had considerable weight in the Assembly of the States. At first
he was persistent in his demands that Lord Ormonde should
come forward with good settlements, but, being made to understand
the state of Irish affairs, he was content to accept what
Lord Ossory’s mother (who could deny nothing to her first-born)
contrived to spare out of her hardly gained pittance.
Moreover, he found the young couple were devotedly attached,
and that Ossory had refused a more advantageous marriage
with the daughter of the Earl of Southampton, in consequence
of his preference for Emilia; and so the marriage was arranged,
Lord Ormonde himself nothing loath that his son’s happiness
should be assured by a connection which he hoped might
also prove beneficial to the King’s interests. One of Lord
Ossory’s daughters married Auverquerque, Earl of Grantham,
and their daughter, Henrietta (eventually sole heiress to her
grandfather), married the second Lord Cowper. From this lady
the present Earl lays claim, not only to titles and estates, but to
a lineal descent from the illustrious patriot, William the Silent.</p>

<p class='c035'>Better times were in store, of however short duration. The
Restoration was at hand, and Ormonde, as may have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>expected, was one of those faithful friends whom the King
‘delighted to honour.’ He was made Lord Steward of the
Household, Duke of Ormonde in the peerage of Ireland, Earl of
Brecknock and Baron Lantony in that of England, and all his
estates, dignities, and privileges in the sister country of which
he had been deprived, restored to him, though, as far as
emolument went, some were scarcely more than nominal. He
walked at the coronation as Lord Steward, and carried St.
Edward’s crown. The Viceroyalty of Ireland, having been
offered to and declined by the Duke of Albemarle, was next
proffered to the Duke of Ormonde, who undertook the thankless
task with eyes sharpened by long experience; and in
so doing he remarked to a friend: ‘Besides many other
disadvantages, there are two proper to me—one of the
contending parties believing that I owe them more kindness
and protection than I find myself chargeable with, and the
other suspecting I entertain that prejudice to them from
which I am free. This temper will be attended undeniably
in them with clamour and scandal upon my most equal and
wary deportment,’—a prophecy which was too soon and too
exactly fulfilled. The Lord-Lieutenant was received with
great pomp and splendour, and a sum of several thousands
voted to facilitate his acceptance of the dignity; but a year
had not elapsed before a deeply-laid plot was discovered to
seize the Castle of Dublin and the person of his Excellency;
and though the principal conspirators were arrested, and some
executed, the arch-traitor Blood, who was one of them,
escaped, with a vow of vengeance in his heart against the
Duke, as will be seen hereafter.</p>

<p class='c035'>Once more in straits for troops for the King’s service,
and money to pay them, Ormonde wrote to the Duke of
Albemarle, asking for five hundred men, to which request he
got the unsatisfactory reply, that Monk himself had not that
number in his whole army upon whose fidelity he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>rely. Ormonde, however, was not discouraged, as we shall
see by an extract from the author already quoted, speaking of
all the difficulties with which the Lord-Lieutenant had to
contend. ‘He was not less indefatigable and prudent than
his enemies were indefatigable, industrious, and artful, but
turned his whole thoughts to raising the distressed kingdom
of Ireland, both in character and circumstances. He gave the
greatest encouragement to learning, fostered trade, and revived
the linen manufacture, which had been founded by Lord
Strafford.’ It seems strange that the Irish, who are among
the best and most skilful artificers of any nation, should
scarcely ever have persisted in any manufacture, among the
many that have been set on foot at different times, with the
exception of this branch, in which they have for so many
years been paramount. The Duke also advocated for Ireland
the advantages of free trade to all foreign nations, in peace
and war; for no ingratitude on the part of his countrymen
ever induced Ormonde to neglect their interests in matters
ecclesiastical, civil, or military. Added to which, he made
the most liberal sacrifices of his own personal property to
advance the interests of the King and the country he ruled;
yet notwithstanding, he was made the mark for calumny
and persecution, in England as well as in Ireland, and the
Duke of Buckingham hated and envied him, and meditated
an impeachment, while Lords Arlington and Shaftesbury were
most inimical to him, neither was he a favourite with the
Queen-Mother, in spite of all the services he had rendered
her.</p>

<p class='c035'>Another formidable adversary was Barbara, Countess of
Castlemaine, afterwards Duchess of Cleveland, the rapacious
mistress of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>, who had given her the Lodge in
Phœnix Park, Dublin. The Lord-Lieutenant refused to confirm
the grant, stopped the warrant, declaring that it was the
proper summer quarter for himself and his successors in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>office. Barbara, as may be expected, never forgave this
interference. Meeting the Duke one day while he was in
London, in the precincts of the Court, she fell on him with
abusive and insulting words, and concluded by saying she
devoutly wished she might live to see him hanged. His Grace
listened with a calm, imperturbable smile to these ravings, and
said he was not in such hot haste to put an end to her
Ladyship’s existence; he should be quite content to live long
enough to see her old and ugly. Neither did the faithful
friendship which existed between the Duke and the Earl of
Clarendon, whose star was now waning, redound to the worldly
advantage of the former.</p>

<p class='c035'>He made more than one journey to England to give an
account of his stewardship to the King, as also to look after
his own interests, well knowing what numbers were plotting
against him. Burnet, Pepys, Evelyn, all pay their tribute to
the Duke during his residence in London at this time, when
Charles, who esteemed him in his heart, was too weak to
uphold him against his arrogant favourite and his other
slanderers. Pepys says: ‘I do hear that my Lord of Ormonde
shall not hold his government of Ireland any longer, which
shows the power of Buckingham and the poor spirit of the
King, and the little hold that any man can have of him.’
Again: ‘This day I do hear that my Lord Ormonde is to be
declared in Council no more Lord-Deputy of Ireland; his time
of commission having expired, the King is prevailed with to
take it out of his hands, which people do mightily admire’
(how many meanings may lie in the same word!), ‘saying
he is the greatest subject of any Prince in Christendom, and
hath done more for his Prince than any ever yet did, but he
must down, it seems: the Duke of Buckingham carries all
before him;’ and so forth. But the machinations of his enemies
succeeded. Lord Robartes reigned in his stead, while the
Duchess went over to Dublin to break up the establishment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>and received an ovation from the people there. Oxford,
of which University the Duke had been made Chancellor,
came forward to show him all the respect he deserved, but
no longer received, at the hands of the weak-spirited Charles,
whom he continued to serve so faithfully. Archbishop Sheldon,
speaking of the Duke’s firmness and temper, which he showed
in the melancholy occasion of his disfavour at Court, says
it insured the admiration of all bystanders beyond everything
he had ever done before,—indeed it was the most glorious part
of his life. One of the principal causes of the King’s coldness
was the resolution Ormonde had formed, and from which he
never swerved: he would not truckle to those female harpies
who were ruining the King not only in his pocket, but in the
estimation of his people. So dignified was Ormonde’s demeanour
that Buckingham asked Charles, ‘Will your Majesty
answer me one question: Is it the Duke who is out of favour
with the King, or the King with the Duke? for, upon my
word, it is your Majesty who looks most out of countenance
when you are together.’</p>

<p class='c035'>People who were not cognisant of the real state of affairs
at Court would sometimes ask him to intercede for some
favour, which caused him to reply: ‘I have no longer the
power to help, only to hurt.’ One day Carey Dillon, afterwards
Lord Roscommon, came and requested the Duke to
assist him with the King in some private affair, saying, ‘I
have no friends but God and yourself.’ ‘Alas!’ said
Ormonde, ‘poor Carey, I pity thee; thou couldst not have
two friends who have less interest at Court or less respect
shown them there.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The Prince of Orange being over in England, the Duke
had been in attendance on his Highness at a banquet given
by the City of London, and was returning to Clarendon
House, where he then lived, in his coach, which was so large
that he had caused iron spikes to be placed at the back, lest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>his footmen should get up, and make it too heavy for the
horses; so six of them walked by the side; but, in spite of this
escort, the coach was stopped by the notorious Blood and
several accomplices, who had been on the watch in St.
James’s Street. They dragged out the Duke, and placed him
behind a horseman, tightly bound by a rope, with orders that
the prisoner should be conveyed to Tyburn, while Blood
galloped on in front to prepare the gallows, with his own
hands, for the execution of the man he detested. But
Ormonde made a stalwart resistance; he struggled so violently
as to impede the progress of the horseman, and at length,
getting his foot under the stirrup, upset his captor, and they
both rolled off together on the pavement. Meantime the coachman
had hastened home, alarmed the servants, with whom
he tore off in pursuit, and by the light (not of the stars of
heaven, but) of the star which the Duke wore, and which
glittered in the flicker of the lamps, they found the struggling
pair, and, rescuing their beloved master, conveyed him home
almost senseless. It was naturally supposed that Blood would
suffer condign punishment; but to the surprise of all—saving,
perhaps, the Duke of Buckingham and the Duchess of Cleveland—the
King not only pardoned him, but gave him later on
an estate in Ireland! It was currently believed at Court that
Buckingham had a hand in this attempt on Ormonde’s life,
and Lord Ossory taxed him with it one day at Court.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘I give you warning,’ said the eager young man, ‘that if
my father comes to a violent death by the hand of a ruffian, or
by secret way of poison, I shall not be at a loss to know who
is the author, but consider you the assassin, and whenever I
meet you will pistol you, though it be behind the King’s
chair. And I tell you this in his Majesty’s presence, that
you may know I will keep my word,’—a threat which the
blustering Duke seems to have found himself obliged to put
up with; at all events, it was said that when Blood was tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>for stealing the Regalia, he accused Buckingham on this
count; and the King, whose unreasonable clemency with
respect to the villain has always remained a mystery, sent to
beg Ormonde’s forgiveness for Blood. The Duke replied to
the messenger: ‘If the King can forgive him for stealing his
crown, I may easily forgive him for attempting my life.’</p>

<p class='c035'>In order to be near his service at Court, the Duke had
taken a house near Windsor, and, being in great favour with
the Queen and the Duchess of York, was often summoned to
play at basset with them. One Sunday, the card-table being
brought out, the Queen invited him to play.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘I hope your Majesty will excuse me,’ he said.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘You surely can have no scruples,’ observed the Queen,
not best pleased; ‘nobody else has any.’</p>

<p class='c035'>‘I beg your Majesty’s pardon,’ was the reply; ‘Christian,
and even Jewish, laws, set apart one day in seven for the service
of God, and cessation from business.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Undoubtedly at this Court card-playing was a business,
and one in no way profitable to the impoverished state of the
Duke’s fortune. We do not know if it were at Windsor or in
London, but, after having been slighted for so long by the
King, Ormonde frequently asked leave to retire from Court.
He one day received the astounding intelligence that his
Majesty would sup with his Grace. The cause of this sudden
step was to announce the Royal intention of reinstating the
Duke of Ormonde in the viceregal power in Ireland, Charles
being thereto instigated, it was said, by the Duke of York,
who feared the post might be offered to the Duke of Monmouth.
We are inclined to believe that it was on this occasion
that the Duchess prepared so sumptuous a repast as to call
forth a lengthened description in Carte’s life of her husband:
‘If she had a fault, ‘twas the height of her spirit, which put her
upon doing everything in a magnificent manner, without regard
for expense.’ Bent on giving his Majesty a noble entertainment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>the Duchess consulted her steward, who expostulated,
as in duty bound, and counselled greater economy; but her
Grace drew herself up, and observed with much dignity:
‘You must allow me to be a better judge of what is fitting for
my own sphere;’ and so the banquet cost over £2000!—if
we may trust the biographer so often quoted. The Duke,
who loved her dearly, never interfered with her financial
arrangements, though he must often have had reason to regret
them.</p>

<p class='c035'>He was once betrayed into a melancholy jest on this subject.
The Duchess had built Dunmore Castle for her jointure-house,
at a large cost, and one day, as the Duke was
walking with a friend on the leads of Kilkenny Castle, which
commanded a fine view of the surrounding country, the new
castle and grounds forming a conspicuous object in the landscape,—‘Your
Grace,’ observed his companion, smiling, ‘has
done a great deal here; but yonder you have <i>done more</i>.’</p>

<p class='c035'>‘Alas!’ replied the Duke, ‘my wife has done so much,
that she has undone me.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The history of his return to power was but a repetition of
all that had gone before. Fresh plots against his authority
and his life, fresh outbreaks of religious strife between Catholics
and Protestants, continued undermining of his interests in
England; but no public trouble could be compared with the
crushing sorrow occasioned by the death of his eldest son,
Lord Ossory, in the prime of life, in the zenith of his reputation.
We have no space to enlarge on the merits of this
noble son of a noble father; he has been immortalised in
the pages of that father’s faithful friend, Lord Clarendon.
Suffice it to say, that all England and Ireland sympathised
with the afflicted parents. The Duchess appears never to
have entirely rallied, for though her death did not occur till
some years later, her health began to fail, and she went
over to Bath for the benefit of the waters. In 1684, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>fever and weakness, this most remarkable woman, the ‘best
helpmate man ever was blessed with,’ died, at the age of sixty-nine,
having married when only fourteen.</p>

<p class='c035'>Her guardian, Lord Holland, had so far neglected her
education, that she had never even learned to write, but she
taught herself by copying print, which was the reason her
letters were never joined together. In appearance she was
tall and well made, but not a beauty; an excellent capacity
for business, good sense and judgment, and, as we have said
before, an undaunted spirit, which fitted her for all the vicissitudes
of her eventful life. Irreproachable in her own conduct,
she avoided the society of the King’s favourites, and ‘would
never wait on the Duchess of Cleveland,’ who was her enemy
in consequence. The Duchess of Portsmouth would take
no denial, and when the Ormondes lived near Windsor would
always be calling, and once she sent word she was coming to
dine. The Duchess, on receiving this semi-royal intimation,
despatched her granddaughters, who were staying with her, to
London, and when ‘La Quérouaille’ arrived she found no
one to sit with her at table, with the exception of the Duke
and Duchess, and their domestic chaplain; whereas, when
the Duke of York married Lady Anne Hyde, and few
were found to pay her court, the Duchess of Ormonde
waited on the bride, and, kneeling, kissed her hand, as
to a Princess of the blood. Queen Catherine esteemed
the Duchess of Ormonde highly, none the less, doubtless, for
the slights she put upon ‘The Castlemaine,’ and made her a
present of her own and the King’s portraits, set in large diamonds,
which their Majesties had exchanged at the Royal
marriage. This jewel was given by the Duke to his grandson’s
wife, Lady Mary Somerset, who was compelled to sell it
for subsistence at the Revolution, when her husband’s estates
passed away from him.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Duke was in England when his wife died, and was inconsolable;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>‘indeed, when alone at night, he was almost distracted.’
The only solace he found was in constant work,
and he hurried over to Dublin to resume his duties; in the
meantime, Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>, who had lately made him an English
Duke, was besieged, as before, with applications once more
to deprive his faithful servant of the Lord-Lieutenancy. For
a while he stood firm, saying he had one of his kingdoms
in good hands, and was resolved to keep it so; and another
time, being asked by my Lord Arlington if the report were
true that the Duke was to be recalled, his Majesty replied
with much anger, ‘It is a damned lie!’ But no one could
trust in the steadfastness of the ‘Merry Monarch.’ Ormonde’s
enemy, Colonel Talbot, made a report on Irish affairs, which
Charles took hold of as a plea for the Duke’s recall. Sir
Robert Southwell wrote to Dublin to give him warning of the
King’s decision.</p>

<p class='c035'>‘They begin early,’ was the reply, ‘to find fault with my
conduct, before I am warm in my post here, or my head
recovered from the agitation of the sea.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> died suddenly, but James lost no time in
carrying out his brother’s intention; Ormonde was superseded
by Lord Clarendon, the King’s father-in-law, and he
had in turn to make way for Ormonde’s bitter enemy,
Colonel Talbot, who, in 1687, was made Earl of Tyrconnell and
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. His Majesty paid the Duke the
scanty compliment of asking him to remain in his post at Court,
which he did, and again carried the Crown at the Coronation.</p>

<p class='c035'>In February 1686 he went to stay a while at Cornbury, a
beautifully situated forest lodge in Oxfordshire, lent him by
his friend, Lord Clarendon, whence he waited on the King
at Bristol; and, being afterwards laid up with gout and
rheumatism at Badminton, James visited him twice in person,
and condescended to request him to continue his place at
Court, though unable to attend. The Duke then proceeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>to Kingston Hall, a country house he had hired in Dorsetshire,
where he died.</p>

<p class='c035'>The constant society of his faithful friends, Sir Robert
Southwell, and the Bishop of Worcester, who had been his
domestic chaplain, cheered his last days, and he took much
delight in seeing little Lord Thurles, his great-grandson, playing
about the room, or in taking the child on his knee to
caress him. One day, appearing more than usually downcast,
he was asked the reason. ‘This is the anniversary of
the saddest day of my life,’ replied the Duke,—‘the day on
which I lost my beloved wife.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He had always been of a religious turn of mind, never
entering on any new duty, or assuming any responsibility,
without writing for himself special prayers to be used on the
occasion. He attended family prayers twice a day up to
the very last, received the Sacrament, selecting his fellow-communicants,
and took a tender leave of his servants, thanking
them for their fidelity, and regretting he had nothing to
leave them, beyond a recommendation in his will to his successor.
His attendants were lifting him from one side of the
bed to the other when his noble spirit passed away, gently,
silently, without a groan or struggle.</p>

<p class='c035'>He had eight sons, all of whom he survived, and two
daughters: of his sons, five died very young, and one under
peculiar (we are tempted to say national) circumstances.
The boy was taking an airing in the Phœnix Park, when the
horses took fright and ran away, and the <i>Irish</i> nurse, anxious
to save the life of her little charge, flung him headlong from
the window!</p>

<p class='c035'>In appearance the first Duke of Ormonde was tall, well-shaped,
and inclined to <i>embonpoint</i>; his complexion was
fair, which gained for him the nickname among the Irish
of Bawn. He was plain, but elegant, in his dress, especially
at Court, when people began to be slovenly; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>wore his hat without a button, uncocked, as it came from
the block, after the fashion of his Majesty. But he was
given to pomp on state occasions; the service of the
Viceregal Court was simply splendid,—numbers of coaches,
horses, and retainers. In travelling he always carried his
staff of office with him, and when they came to a town, his
gentleman (bareheaded) bore it through the streets, before
his Grace’s coach. He used often to revert in after days to
an incident which might well ‘point a moral’ on the danger
of that offence, so frequently considered venial,—a white lie.
One time, when Lord Ormonde was in France, it was deemed
necessary he should go over suddenly and secretly to Ireland
for the King’s service, and he accordingly embarked in a small
boat, on a stormy day. ‘The master came up to his noble
passenger during the voyage, and inquired the hour, and
Lord Ormonde, being very anxious to make as quick a
passage as possible, told the man an hour later than the real
time. The consequence was, that the skipper miscalculated
the time of the tide and the boat was wrecked, split in two
on the rocks, and Lord Ormonde had to take to the cock-boat,
and, finally, to be carried ashore on the shoulders of the seamen.
There was no help at hand, for the good people of
Havre were all at church, it being a festival. Thus, in consequence
of a white lie, told with an excellent motive, the
whole crew were nearly drowned, and the delay so great as
to endanger the success of the undertaking in which Lord
Ormonde was engaged.</p>

<p class='c035'>We will end a notice, which has had little that is cheerful
or exhilarating in its pages, with a repartee which the
Duke made to a friend of the family, one Mr. Cottington, who
lived near Dublin, and had a pretty house on the sea-shore.
The Duke’s third son, Lord Gowran, a most genial and popular
member of society, who had given his father much anxiety on
account of the laxity of his morals, had presented Mr. Cottington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>with a set of the Ten Commandments to place over the
altar in his new chapel at his marine villa. Much delighted,
and doubtless edified, by so appropriate a donation, Mr.
Cottington expressed his gratification to the Duke, who thus
answered him: ‘I think I can guess at the nature of my
son’s generosity; he can easily part with things he does not
intend to keep!’</p>

BORN at Aussig, in Bohemia, the second son
of Ismael Mengs, a native of Copenhagen,
miniature painter to Augustus the Strong,
King of Poland. Ismael brought up his
boys as painters; he gave them, when quite
children, nothing but pencils for playthings,
keeping them at work sometimes for sixteen hours a day.
After a while the eldest son rebelled against this close application,
and made his escape from home, taking refuge with the
Jesuits at Prague; but Raphael inherited his father’s love of
art, and laboured diligently.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1740 Ismael took him to Rome, where the same rigid
course of study was enforced; the youth was constantly
locked up in the Vatican with his work cut out for him,—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>copy Raphael, Michael Angelo, or the antique the whole day
long, with a loaf of bread and a pitcher of water. On the
days passed at home, the father kept his son a prisoner in the
same manner, and would go out for hours on his own concerns,
with the key of the room in his pocket. These early lessons
of industry and application bore ample fruit in the future life
of this indefatigable painter. Returning to Dresden, the
young man’s miniature copies of Raphael, and some excellent
portraits in pastel, pleased King Augustus so much that he
appointed Raphael Mengs his Painter-in-Ordinary, with a
considerable salary. To his Majesty’s surprise, and the
great displeasure of Count Brühl, Raphael declined, on the
plea that he was too young for such a post. Rome had
great attractions for him, and thither he returned. He
painted a ‘Holy Family,’ which gained him much credit,
the original of Our Lady being a beautiful girl, Margaret
Guazzi by name, the child of poor parents, and as good as
she was beautiful. The young painter became a proselyte
to the Roman Catholic faith, and married his lovely model,
nor had ever cause to repent his choice. He remained at
Rome several years, painting assiduously, and studying in
the Hospital of San Spirito; it was in obedience to his
father’s wishes that he returned to Dresden, with much regret,
and was obliged by so doing to forfeit many advantageous commissions.
Old Ismael, whose nature was violent and cruel,
repaid his son’s devotion by turning him, his wife, and infant
child into the streets on some trifling disagreement. The
story came to the King’s ears, and he once more offered the
rejected post to young Mengs, with an increased salary, a
house, and carriage. This time the Royal bounty was accepted
with gratitude, for Raphael was now a husband and a father.
The King was at that time employed in building the Catholic
church at Dresden, where the Royal Family still carry on their
separate worship,—it being one of the few (is it not the only?)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>capitals where the Court and the subjects profess a different
creed. Raphael Mengs painted the lateral altars, and had a
commission for the high altar-piece; but the longing was upon
him, in no way singular, to return to Rome, and he pleaded
that he would execute the order far better in Italy. He
repaired thither, and, after making a copy of the school of
Athens for the Earl of Northumberland, he began his altar-piece
for Dresden. ‘The Seven Years’ War now broke out,
and Augustus was deprived of his electorate, and found himself
unable to continue Mengs’s salary. The failure of this income,
added to his own improvidence, plunged our artist into
poverty; he was obliged to take any orders that offered, and
accept any terms proposed, in order to keep the wolf from the
door. The fresco which he executed for the monks in the
Church of Sant’ Eusebio brought him little pay indeed, but
great increase of popularity. He did not carry out a commission
he had received from King Augustus to go to Naples
and paint the Royal Family, supposing the order to be cancelled;
but the Duke of Censano, Neapolitan Minister to the
Papacy, urged him to fulfil it, and wrote to Naples, specifying
the prices which the now popular painter had received in
Saxony. Just as he was starting for Naples, rumours were
set afloat which troubled Mengs exceedingly; he was
assured that a picture which had been ordered for the Chapel-Royal
at Caserta was not required, and that the King and
Queen declined to sit to him on account of his prices being
reckoned exorbitant. He was perplexed how to act, when the
arrival of the Polish Minister from Naples set his mind at rest.
Count Lagnasco assured him that the altar-piece for Caserta
was daily expected, and that the King and Queen had never
demurred at the prices, but were only displeased at the delay.
He therefore hastened to Naples, but, on his arrival, found the
King and Queen on the eve of embarkation for their new
kingdom of Spain, and too much engrossed by their preparations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>to give him sittings. They, however, commanded a
portrait of their son Ferdinand, about to ascend the vacant
throne of Naples. The jealousy of his brother artists made
the fair city insupportable to Mengs, and he again took his way
to Rome, where he was very popular, and had plenty of work.
He adorned the beautiful Villa Albani with classical frescoes,
and painted numerous pictures, chiefly for English and Neapolitan
patrons. Charles <span class='fss'>III.</span>, King of Spain, hearing him
highly spoken of, now proposed to Raphael Mengs to enter
his service, with a large salary, a house, and carriage, and all
materials for painting provided; also a free passage for himself
and family on a Spanish vessel sailing from Naples.</p>

<p class='c035'>Mengs accepted, and was kindly received by the King, but
soon found he had to encounter the bitter hatred of all the
artists in the Spanish capital. Giaquinto, an Italian, who had
hitherto enjoyed the Royal favour, was so disgusted at the
success of Mengs, that he abandoned the field, and, leaving
Spain in dudgeon, returned to his own country. Mengs was
now employed in the decoration of the new palace, and
painted the Gods of Olympus in the bedchamber of the
King, Aurora in that of the Queen, and Morning, Noon,
Evening, and Night in the apartments of the Infanta, besides
numerous easel pictures.</p>

<p class='c035'>He was also appointed honorary member of the Academy
of St. Ferdinand, where, being desirous of instituting new
regulations and bringing about reforms, he provoked much ill-will,
and being himself of a hot and hasty temper, bickerings
and disagreements ensued without number. Altogether,
Raphael Mengs was far from happy during his sojourn at
Madrid; the climate was most injurious to his health,
which declined daily, yet he never slackened in his toil,
but worked unremittingly from dawn till dusk, and often
far into the night. He had already despatched his wife and
family to Rome, and now asked permission to join them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>Suffering and melancholy, he proceeded on his solitary way,
and was delayed some time at Monaco by increased illness;
at length he arrived in his beloved Rome, where the affection
of his dear ones and the warmth of the climate partially revived
him. He now turned his attention chiefly to sacred subjects,
and in loving memory of his favourite Notte di Coreggio in
the Dresden Gallery, executed a Nativity on the same plan,
where all the light emanated from the Holy Child; introducing
his own portrait as one of the adoring shepherds.
Pope Clement <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> gave Mengs a labour of love to perform,
and in that light he considered it, for he stipulated that he
should receive no payment: this was to decorate the walls of
the hall destined for the reception of the papyrus rolls in the
Vatican. To work beneath the same roof which his illustrious
namesake had sanctified, was indeed a glory!</p>

<p class='c035'>Although enfeebled in health, Mengs was comparatively
content, both in the matter of his residence and his work; but
he received a warning from Madrid that his leave of absence
had been too long exceeded, and it required all the kind
intercession of Don Joseph de Azara, Spanish Envoy at Rome,
and Mengs’s great friend, to intercede with the King on this
score. At last there was a compromise, Mengs agreeing to
go to Naples to paint the portraits of the reigning King and
Queen for the gallery at Madrid. But his industry seemed on
this occasion to forsake him; when in Naples he was very
dilatory over his commission, and spent his time in buying
coins and vases to add to his collection; and on his return
to Rome he had only finished the heads. Then he had to conclude
his work in the Vatican, and take leave of the Pope,
who gave him a rosary of lapis-lazuli and a set of medals
struck during his Pontificate. So little was Mengs in haste to
reach Spain that he stopped by the way at Florence to paint
the Grand Duke and Duchess, with many other portraits.</p>

<p class='c035'>He arrived at Madrid, and recommenced his labours in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>palace, to the great satisfaction of King Charles; went to
Aranjuez, where he worked both in the palaces and the
churches; but relapsed into bad health, and became so ill
that the kind-hearted monarch would no longer detain him,
and sent him back to Rome,—‘with,’ says Sir William
Stirling, ‘a stipend far beyond his requirements, and a fame
far beyond his merits.’ Charles also settled dowries on the
daughters of Raphael Mengs; but alas! he had not been
long at home before his good and beautiful wife died; and
he strove to console himself by working harder than ever.</p>

<p class='c035'>The winter was unusually severe, his studio was overheated,
and the bad air increased his malady. His frame became
emaciated, and his features so ghastly as to attract the notice
of every one. One of his pictures, purchased by an Englishman,
met with a strange fate: despatched to England by sea,
the vessel was taken by a French cruiser, and the picture
sent to Paris. Eventually Louis <span class='fss'>XVI.</span> sent it as a present to
the Empress Catherine of Russia.</p>

<p class='c035'>In spite of the expostulations of his children, Mengs
now put himself into the hands of a German quack, and, to
follow his directions without opposition, took a lodging by
himself, first in Via Condotti, and then in the Gregoriana.</p>

<p class='c035'>A nun at Narni had lately gained great popularity by
selling a decoction of holy jessamines, by which she worked
miraculous cures. To a strong dose of this medicine the quack
doctor added a still more efficacious dose of antimony, and
thus indeed relieved the poor painter from all further suffering,
physical or mental. He worked to the last, and died in June
1779, being buried at San Michele, on the Janiculan Hill,
followed by the Professors of the Academy of St. Luke. Don
Joseph de Azara, knowing his friend’s tastes, erected a cenotaph
to his memory, adorned with a bronze portrait, close to the
monument of his illustrious namesake and idol, the divine
Raphael. By nature Mengs was choleric and melancholy, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>prone to be ruffled by the petty ills of life than satisfied by his
success, which is generally allowed to have been far above
his deserts. He was self-willed even to arrogance in his
opinions. Finding fault with some Venetian pictures Pope
Clement had bought, his Holiness remarked they had been
much admired by other artists. ‘Ah,’ replied Mengs, ‘they
praise what is above their powers; I despise what is below mine.’</p>

<p class='c035'>He was severe on other Art writers, and especially on the
works of Sir Joshua Reynolds; Azara said he was very
truthful, and tells how on one occasion Mengs declared he
had never taken a pinch of snuff, though in so doing he
would have redeemed a collection of valuable snuff-boxes,
the presents of many grandees, from the clutches of the Custom-House
officers, who seized them as merchandise. Yet he
practised a hoax on his friend Winckelman, and allowed him
to publish in his book the description of a ‘Ganymede’ by
Mengs, which the painter had passed off on the Professor as
an antique. He was a faithful and affectionate husband, a
tender and loving father, and gave his children a good
education,—but little beside, for, with all the riches he had
acquired, he was both extravagant and improvident, and at his
death he only left his collections of coins and casts, bequeathed
to the King of Spain, and a number of engravings, which were
bought by the Empress of Russia. Mengs’s eldest daughter,
Anna Maria, was a successful portrait-painter; married to
Manuel Salvador Camoni, a member of the Academy of San
Fernando, she died at Madrid in 1798. He would not allow
his sons to become painters, ‘for,’ said he, ‘if they were inferior
to me, I should despise them; if superior, I should be jealous
of them.’ One of his sons became a soldier in the service of
Spain. Mengs wrote much on the subject of Art, had great
command of language, and was a good linguist.</p>

town of Plymouth, Northcote boasted of a
long pedigree, and maintained that his
family was of very good standing in the

THE youngest daughter of Richard Jennings,
Esq. of Sundridge, near St. Albans, by
the daughter and heir of Sir Gifford Hornhurst.
When quite young she went to
Court, where her sister Frances (afterwards
Lady Tyrconnell) was already remarkable, as
much for the laxity of her conduct as for her beauty. Sarah’s
features may not have been as regular as those of her sister,
but her countenance was most expressive, her complexion
beautiful, and the profusion of her fair hair, formed a most
attractive combination. Amidst her crowd of adorers, the
young, handsome, and insinuating Colonel Churchill stood
pre-eminent; he was poor, and by many accused of avarice
already, yet he preferred the portionless girl to a rich heiress
with a plain face, when the match was suggested to him.</p>

<p class='c035'>Sarah Jennings was a woman of inordinate ambition and
iron will, and she made use of her close friendship with the
Princess (afterwards Queen) Anne to rise in the world and
push her husband’s fortunes, even before his own distinguished
talents had insured his eminence. The tyranny which the
high-spirited, hot-tempered Lady of the Bedchamber exercised
over her Royal mistress for many years are matters too well
known to be here recapitulated. The romantic correspondence
between ‘Mrs. Morley’ and ‘Mrs. Freeman,’ showing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>manner in which Queen Anne, even after her marriage, gave
herself up to the dominion of her favourite, until the self-imposed
yoke became intolerable, and was suddenly and
completely severed, are historical facts bound up with public
events. The Duchess of Marlborough was supplanted by
her own <i>protégée</i>, Mrs. Masham, and peremptorily dismissed,
in spite of ‘rages, prayers, and scenes.’ Voltaire says:
‘Quelques paires de gants qu’elle refusa à la Reine, un verre
d’eau qu’elle laissa tomber sur la robe de Madame Masham,
changèrent la face de Europe!’—alluding to the political
changes which followed the downfall of Sarah. In her latter
days her temper became ungovernable; she quarrelled with
her husband, her son-in-law, her grandchildren; and on one
occasion, when the Duke, wishing to pacify her rage, complimented
her on her long fair hair, which was still luxuriant,
the furious lady cut it off, and flung it in her husband’s face!
At his death a long coil of golden tresses was found in the
Duke’s drawer. Sarah survived her husband twenty years,
and, in spite of her age (it must be remembered she was
very rich), had many suitors, amongst them the Duke of
Somerset and Lord Coningsby. To the latter, after reminding
him she was sixty-three, she replied: ‘Were I only thirty,
and you could lay the world at my feet, I would never
bestow on you the heart and hand which belonged exclusively
to John, Duke of Marlborough.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Cowper (the Chancellor’s wife) saw a great deal of
the Duchess at Court; they exchanged constant visits, and
corresponded, but Lady Cowper had no opinion of her Grace;
she describes her trying to make mischief by repeating ill-natured
speeches, and goes on to say: ‘She is certainly an
ill woman, and does not care what she says of anybody, to
wreak her malice or revenge.’</p>

    <div>ROBERT HARLEY, EARL OF OXFORD.</div>
    <div class='c000'><i>Black and gold dress.</i></div>
    <div class='c000'>BORN 1661, DIED 1724.</div>

STUDIED under the famous Dr. Birch (who
boasted of the number of statesmen he had
educated), and showed great promise. In
1688 he raised a troop of horse for the service
of William of Orange, whom he joined,
but who showed him no particular favour.
Harley sat in Parliament, but waited for office till 1704, when
Queen Anne gave him a seat in the Council, and made him
Secretary of State. He was much opposed to Godolphin
and Marlborough, and made common cause with the Queen’s
new favourite, Mrs. Masham, to overthrow the power of the
Whigs.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Ministers insisted on his dismissal, but Anne
stood by him as long as she could; when Harley was compelled
to resign, the Queen said to him: ‘You see the unfortunate
condition of monarchs,—they are obliged to give
up their friends to please their enemies;’ but so high was
Anne’s opinion of Harley, that she constantly consulted him
on public affairs, when out of office.</p>

<p class='c035'>On the downfall of the Whig Administration, he was made
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Treasurer.</p>

<p class='c035'>He was much censured, even by his own party, for some
of his financial measures, by which, however, he enriched the
Royal coffers. In March 1711, an event happened that
made a great noise, and rendered Harley the hero of the day.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>A French adventurer, called Bourlie, or the Marquis de Guiscard
and Langalleve, was a shifty individual, who acted first
as a spy of England against France, and then of France
against England, being in the pay of both. His intrigues were
discovered, and he was brought before the Privy Council.
Believing that Harley had been instrumental in his detection,
he resolved to be revenged. While waiting his turn for examination,
he found means to secrete about his person a penknife
which was lying on the table, among some papers. No
sooner was he brought forward than he rushed in a fury upon
Harley, and stabbed him several times, the Minister falling
senseless on the ground, covered with blood. A scene of confusion
ensued, and the Duke of Buckingham, drawing his
sword, wounded the assassin, who was conveyed to Newgate,
where he died in a few days, either from the effect of the
sword-thrusts, or by his own hand.</p>

<p class='c035'>The event seemed to have revived Harley’s popularity:
both Houses presented an address to the Queen, assuring her
that Harley’s loyalty had brought this attack upon him, etc.
etc., and when he reappeared in the House, a brilliant reception
awaited him; and a Bill was passed making an attempt
on the life of a Privy Councillor a felony which deprived the
offender of benefit of clergy. In the same year, Robert
Harley, being then Lord High Treasurer, was created Baron
Wigmore, and Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, and next year he
received the Garter, and became Prime Minister of England.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lords Oxford and Bolingbroke at first worked together to
withstand the power of the Opposition, and to bring about the
pacification of Europe; and the Peace of Utrecht added to the
popularity of the ministerial party. But dissensions arose between
Bolingbroke and the Premier, and recriminations and
fresh intrigues, in which Mrs. Masham was implicated, all of
which belong to England’s political history.</p>

<p class='c035'>Oxford was deprived of all his offices, and accused of plotting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>in favour of the Pretender. The Queen died, and in
1715 he was sent to the Tower, on an accusation of high
treason. He was imprisoned for two years, and on his release
gave himself up to the enjoyment of art and literature; he
formed a magnificent library, which cost him a fortune, not
only from the splendour of the works themselves, but on
account of their sumptuous binding. His collection of <span class='fss'>MSS.</span>,
called after him the Harleian <span class='fss'>MSS.</span>, which was afterwards
greatly increased by his son, is now one of the glories of the
British Museum; it was purchased by the Government after
the second Lord Oxford’s death.</p>

<p class='c035'>Few men have been more eulogised on the one hand, and
reviled on the other, but he has been unanimously described
as a kind patron of men of letters.</p>

<p class='c035'>It was Harley who brought into operation the measure
known to posterity as ‘The South Sea Bubble,’ which entailed
ruin on numbers; and in spite of much opposition he also
established State lotteries.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Oxford was twice married: first to Elizabeth, daughter
of Thomas Foley, of Whitley Court, county Worcester, by
whom he had one son and two daughters; and secondly,
to Sarah, daughter of Thomas Myddleton, Esq., who was
childless.</p>

    <div class='c000'><span class='sc'>By Sir Joshua Reynolds.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c033'>She was the only daughter of Sir Ralph
Milbanke, of Halnaby Hall, county York.
In 1769 she married Sir Peniston Lamb,
Bart., M.P., who was created Viscount
Melbourne in 1770. She was a beautiful
young woman of twenty when she first
went to London, and took the town by storm. She was as
much admired for her vivacity as her beauty, and Sir Joshua
Reynolds speaks of her as figuring at one of the fashionable
masquerades of the day in domino and tricorne hat, as ‘a
pretty fellow’ or maccaroni, with the Duchess of Ancaster
and Lady Fordyce, and a charming portrait, in possession of
Lord Southampton, represents her in this costume. Lady
Melbourne persuaded her husband to buy a house in Piccadilly
from Mr. Fox (father of Charles James), who had been a
friend of Sir Matthew Lamb, next door to Burlington House,
which cost a large sum. Lady Melbourne called it after her
husband’s title, and took the greatest delight in furnishing
and adorning the interior, on which work she employed
Cipriani, Wheatley, the humorous designer Rebecca, and all
the best decorative artists of the day. The society was as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>brilliant as the walls which encircled them; and Royalty,
fashion, beauty, and talent flocked to the receptions at
Melbourne House, whose master, bent on pleasing his
beautiful wife, threw open his gates with lavish hospitality.
Sir Joshua was an intimate, as well as a general guest, and
thus had many opportunities of studying the form and features
which he afterwards immortalised in the picture that heads
this notice. It was painted in 1770, just after Sir Peniston
Lamb’s elevation to the peerage and the birth of his eldest
son.</p>

<p class='c035'>No sooner was the London house completed, than Lady
Melbourne turned her attention to the embellishment of her
husband’s country seat in Hertfordshire, where, in company
with her chosen friend, Mrs. Damer (alike charming as a
woman and an artist), she planned and arranged the internal
decorations of Brocket Hall. Wheatley was again called in,
and, with the assistance of Mortimer, painted the ceilings
with allegorical subjects. The two ladies were also much
addicted to the pastime of private theatricals, as was their
mutual friend, the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire; while
such names as Sheridan, Fox, Horace Walpole, and other
celebrities, figured as actors and authors in Lady Melbourne’s
company. It was here, doubtless, that Lord Egremont (then
a youth) imbibed that love of art, and that taste for the society
of artists, which made him so noble and munificent a patron,
to the end of a long life. He was a great friend of the
Melbournes, and loved to see his ‘three young lambs’
gambolling over the greensward in his spacious park at
Petworth.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Melbourne was very popular with the Royal Family,
and one day the Duke of York called on her, and in the
course of conversation became very enthusiastic in his
admiration of Melbourne House. He confessed he was
weary of his own at Whitehall, and would gladly move
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>into her neighbourhood. The lady laughed, and said, for
her part, she often wished to exchange the chimes of St.
James’s Church for those of Westminster Abbey; and they
talked on, half jestingly, half in earnest, till the possibility
of an exchange of residence was mooted. It appeared
strange, but perhaps the amateur house-decorator was lured
by the prospect of new walls to beautify, fresh fields to conquer.
Before the Duke took his leave, he had gained her
Ladyship’s promise to discuss the subject with her husband:
‘For you know, dear Lady Melbourne, you always have your
way with everybody, especially with my Lord.’</p>

<p class='c035'>His Royal Highness was right: if Lord Melbourne raised
any objection at first, it was soon overcome; the consent of
the Crown was gained, the bargain was struck, the house at
Whitehall became Melbourne House, and the residence in
Piccadilly, York House, afterwards changed to the Albany,
where, in the oldest portion and principal apartments of that
paradise of bachelors, the decorations of Cipriani and his
colleagues may still be admired.</p>

<p class='c035'>All contemporary writers speak of Lady Melbourne as a
leader of fashion and an ornament of society; Horace
Walpole, in particular, alludes to her frequently, ‘in wonderful
good looks,’ at the Prince of Wales’s birthday ball at Carlton
House, and again at the French Ambassador’s, where it was
so hot he was nearly stewed, but ‘the quadrilles were surprisingly
pretty, especially that one in which Lady Melbourne,
Lady Sefton, and Princess Czartorisky figured, in blue satin
and gold, with collars mounted <i>à la reine Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<p class='c035'>In 1805 her eldest son died; but the mother seems to have
been consoled by the promise of future greatness shown by
her second son, William, who early evinced a taste for public
life, which harmonised with Lady Melbourne’s views. She took
a great interest in political affairs, was a staunch Whig, and at
the time of Charles Fox’s famous election, she displayed as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>much zeal and enthusiasm as her rival beauty, the Duchess of
Devonshire. William Lamb’s marriage with the daughter of
Lord Bessborough, which enlarged his connection with all the
principal Whig families, was a source of great pleasure to Lady
Melbourne. It was a pity, with her political predilections,
she did not survive to see her favourite son and her daughter’s
second husband each rise to the coveted position of Prime
Minister of England.</p>

<p class='c035'>We have no authority for stating in what light Lady
Melbourne viewed her daughter-in-law’s infatuation for Lord
Byron; but we know, from his own letters, that he entertained
a great admiration for herself. He had never met with so
charming a woman. ‘If she had only been some years
younger, what a fool she would have made of me!’ With
her he kept up unvarying friendly relations during all the
vicissitudes of his love and hate passages with Lady Caroline.
One day he called on Lady Melbourne, and asked her advice
and sympathy. She was a model confidante, and had once
given it as her opinion, that few men could be trusted with
their neighbours’ secrets, and scarcely any woman with her
own. Byron assured her he was wearied with his way of life,
that he wished to marry and reform, and settle down at
Newstead, and asked if she would assist him in his choice of
a wife. Lady Melbourne smiled, and said she thought she
knew of the very woman to suit him—her near kinswoman, Miss
Milbanke, daughter of Sir Noel Milbanke, heiress to a large
fortune, and a peerage in her own right, as Lady Wentworth,—no
great beauty, but not uncomely, well brought up, well
educated, and amiable. Byron was quite satisfied, but, as may
be expected, when Lady Caroline heard of it, she was furious.
‘The girl has a bad figure, is given to statistics, and goes
regularly to church,—a pretty wife for a poet!’ The lady
refused the man, of whose moral character she had heard a
sorry account; but he persisted, and the marriage took place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>in 1816,—an ill-fated union, as might have been expected,
a fact but too well known. Lady Melbourne’s health began
to fail; she drooped gradually, till one day the sentence
was pronounced in her hearing—she had but a short time to
live. She heard the announcement with calmness, took an
affectionate leave of those she loved, and addressed some
parting admonitions to her beloved William, which he
never forgot. Lady Melbourne died on the 6th April 1818,
at Whitehall, and was buried at Hatfield Church. Her son
Frederick was absent from England at the time.</p>

SHE was the only daughter of the first Earl of
Bessborough, by Lady Henrietta Spencer,
daughter of the first Earl Spencer. She was
in Italy when a child, with her mother, but, on
their return to England, Lady Bessborough
being in very delicate health, Lady Caroline
was intrusted for a time to the care of her aunt, the beautiful
Duchess of Devonshire. Throughout her life she kept a diary,
and she gives a detailed record of her early days at Devonshire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>House. The children saw very little of their elders, and were
brought up with a strange mixture of luxury and laxity. The
nursery table was covered with dainties, and served with goodly
plate, but the young lords and ladies were allowed to run wild
backwards and forwards between the servants’ apartments
in search of sweetmeats and ‘goodies.’ Caroline’s education
was little cared for, her knowledge circumscribed, and she only
believed in two classes of society,—aristocrats and beggars.
At ten years old she could scarcely write, and could not spell
at all; but she composed verses, ‘which were pronounced
splendid in the family, and everybody petted me, especially
my cousin Hartington (afterwards Duke of Devonshire), who
was my constant companion. My chief delight consisted in
polishing my specimens of Derbyshire spar, washing my dog,
and breaking in a pony.’ Caroline was transferred from
Devonshire to Spencer House, to live with her grandmother,
and the change did not suit her small ladyship. ‘How well
I remember the grand housekeeper, in a hoop and ruffles, who
presided over seventy servants.’ Under Lady Spencer’s roof,
of whom the poet Cowper speaks so highly, and to whom
Horace Walpole, with his usual sneer, alludes as ‘the goddess
of wisdom,’ it may be imagined the girl was subjected to a discipline
which was so different from the liberty of Devonshire
House that she soon broke out into open rebellion. ‘I was
indeed very naughty, and used to give way to such paroxysms
of rage that a physician was called in. Dr. Warren forbade
all study, and desired that my brain should lie fallow. I
believe he feared for my reason. I was very fond of music,
and cried when I had to give it up. My governess was too
severe, my relations too indulgent.’ It was not until Lady
Caroline was fifteen that she tried to make up for lost time.
As regarded her education, she showed great aptitude for
languages,—French, Italian, Latin, ‘and I had even mastered
enough Greek to enable me to enjoy a classical play, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>taken to speech-day at Harrow, where my brother was at
school.’ She could recite an ode of Sappho to admiring
listeners at Devonshire or Spencer House, and was much
praised and petted. She piqued herself on her unconventionality,
and would plunge into intimacy, or manifest her aversion
in the most unequivocal manner. Among the frequent guests
at Spencer House was William Lamb, the second son of Lord
Melbourne. It would seem strange that the vigilance of the
young lady’s relations should not have been awakened by the
growing intimacy between her and the captivating younger
son. Well bred, well born, with a ringing laugh and an inexpressible
charm, which never forsook him in advanced life
amid the turmoil of politics, William Lamb had everything to
recommend him but a birthright,—and had it not been settled
in the family that Caroline was to make a brilliant marriage?
Lady Caroline, who loved to record her own adventures,
writes to her friend and confidante, Lady Morgan, not very
long before her death, recalling her past life: ‘I fell in love,
when only twelve years old, with a friend of Charles Fox,—a
friend of liberty, whose poems I had read, whose self I had
never seen, and, when I did see him, at thirteen, could I
change? I was more attached than ever. William Lamb
was beautiful, and far the cleverest person then about, the
most daring in his opinions, in his love of liberty and independence.
He thought of me but as a child; yet he liked
me much. Afterwards he wished to marry me, and I refused
him because of my temper.’ In another letter she says: ‘I
was a fury. He asked me a second time, and this time he was
not refused, for I adored him.’ The lady’s relations were
reconciled to the match, possibly influenced in some slight
degree by the consideration that William Lamb had become
heir to a large fortune and a peerage, in consequence of the
death of his elder brother.</p>

<p class='c035'>Marriages never come single in a family. Lamb’s sister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>Emily was already engaged, and in the year 1805, within a
month of each other, the brother was united to Lady Caroline
Ponsonby, and the sister to Lord Cowper. Mr. Lamb and
his wife passed the early days of their married life between
Brocket (Lord Melbourne’s) and Panshanger (Lord Cowper’s)
Houses in Hertfordshire; and when the London season began,
Lady Caroline contributed not a little to the former attractions
of Melbourne House, where she and her husband took up
their abode. Society was at variance as to the bride’s merits;
her eccentricities amused many of the guests, and affronted
others,—for some people are indignant when merely called
upon to stare at what is said to them. The Prince of Wales,
an <i>habitué</i> of Melbourne House, was one of those who
encouraged Lady Caroline in her wayward and wilful moods;
her startling speeches, her flighty coquetry, her sudden
quarrels, and as sudden reconciliations, whether with her
husband or any other member of the community, were a great
source of amusement to his Royal Highness. Miss Berry
speaks of meeting the Prince at Lady Caroline Lamb’s in the
year 1808. She says in her Diary: ‘It was an immense
assembly. We came away at half-past twelve, and had to
walk beyond the Admiralty to our carriage. Many of the
company did not leave till past three; the Prince of Wales
had supped below, in Lady Melbourne’s apartments, and
remained till past six. Sheridan was there, and quite drunk.’
It would appear by these remarks that Lady Melbourne had
vacated a suite of apartments in favour of her daughter-in-law,
who received on her own account, as in another passage in Miss
Berry’s correspondence there is mention, ‘I am going to Lady
Caroline Lamb’s to-night. She gives a party, to be convenient
for hearing what is going on, about this famous motion in the
House of Peers.’ But Lady Caroline was of too romantic a
turn of mind to be absorbed by politics; she had always some
small flirtation on hand, and her admirers were frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>under age. We read in the Life of the late Lord Lytton some
very early passages between him and this mature object of
his adoration,—assignations entered into, notes passing clandestinely,
engagements to dance broken off and renewed with
playful inconstancy. Excitement, even on so small a scale,
seemed necessary to the lady’s existence; she would have been
bored to death without it. The novelist admired his goddess
enough to put her in print, and describes the compassion she
displayed one day, when, finding a beggar who had met with
an accident, she insisted on his being lifted, rags and all, into
the carriage beside her, when she drove the cripple to his
destination.</p>

<p class='c035'>But a luminary was about to appear on the horizon, which
was destined to eclipse all lesser lights. Here is her own
account of her first acquaintance with Lord Byron: ‘Rogers,
who was one of my adorers, and extolled me up to the skies,
said to me one evening, “You must know the new poet.” He
offered to lend me the proofs of <i>Childe Harold</i> to read.
That was enough for me. Rogers said, “He has a club foot,
and bites his nails.” I said, “If he were as ugly as Æsop I
must know him.” Lady Westmoreland had met Byron in
Italy; she undertook to present him. I looked earnestly
at him, and turned on my heel,’—conduct which the poet
afterwards reproached her with. London had gone mad about
him. All the ladies were pulling caps for him. He said once
ostentatiously: ‘The women positively suffocate me.’ That
night the entry in Lady Caroline’s Diary was—‘Mad, bad, and
dangerous to know.’ She declared at first she had no intention
of attracting him, but she confesses how she had come in
from riding one windy, rainy day, all muddy and dishevelled,
and had been conversing with Moore and Rogers in that
plight, when Byron was announced, and she flew out of the
room to beautify herself. ‘Lord Byron wished to come and
see me at eight o’clock, when I was alone. That was my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>dinner-hour. I said he might. From that moment, for many
months, he almost lived at Melbourne House.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Hartington, Lady Caroline’s favourite cousin, expressed
a wish to have some dancing of an evening at Whitehall,
as his stepmother (Lady Elizabeth Foster) objected to
anything of the kind at Devonshire House, and accordingly
for a time the drawing-room at Melbourne House was turned
into a ball-room. But as Lord Byron’s lameness cut him off
from the quadrilles and waltzes, this arrangement did not suit
him, and his word being law with Lady Caroline, the dancing
was soon discontinued. It was a strange flirtation between
the poet and the poetaster. The lady would lie awake half
the night composing verses, which she would repeat the next
day to the great man, in the fond hope of a few crumbs of
praise, a commodity of which Byron was very sparing, he
being a great deal more taken up with giving utterance to his
own effusions. Lady Caroline was often mortified, Lord
Byron often wearied,—at least so it would appear. Lord
Holland came up to them one evening as they were sitting
side by side as usual, with a silver censer in his hand. ‘I am
come,’ he said, ‘Lady Caroline, to offer you your due.’ ‘By
no means,’ she returned in a tone of pique; ‘pray give it all
to Lord Byron. He is so accustomed to incense that he
cannot exist without it.’</p>

<p class='c035'>A recent biography describes the situation well when it
says: ‘He grew moody, and she fretful, when their mutual
egotisms jarred.’ William Lamb’s wife was certainly not
formed to make home happy. One day she extolled his
generosity and lack of jealousy; another, she accused him of
apathy and indifference with regard to her flirtations. Her
conduct was marked by alternate tenderness and ill-temper:
there could be no doubt of her affection for her invalid boy,
yet her treatment of him was spasmodic and fitful,—now
devoted, now neglectful. More than once a separation had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>been agreed upon, and Mr. Lamb had even gone so far as to
forbid his wife the house, and believed she was gone. He
went to his own room, locked himself in, and sat brooding
over his troubles. It was growing late, when he was attracted
by the well-known sound of scratching at the door, and he
rose to let in his favourite dog. But lo! the intruder was no
other than his wife, who, crouching on the floor, had made
use of this stratagem to gain admittance. Half indignant,
half amused, he did not long resist the glamour which this
eccentric woman knew how to throw around him. Peace was
restored for a short time, but not for long; another explosion,
a violent domestic quarrel, occurred one night in London.
Lady Caroline went out, called a hackney coach, and in her
evening dress—a white muslin frock, blue sash, and diamond
necklace—drove to the house of a physician, whom she
scarcely knew. She describes with great unction the surprise
and admiration of the assembled guests, ‘who took me for a
child, and were surprised at my fine jewels.’</p>

<p class='c035'>It was her cherished vanity to be taken for a young
unmarried girl. Her relations were much alarmed at her
disappearance. Lady Spencer sent to Lord Byron’s house,
who disclaimed all knowledge of the truant. After creating a
great excitement in the good doctor’s drawing-room, the lady
returned home, to enjoy another scene and another reconciliation.
Her mother, Lady Bessborough, who was in very
delicate health, was deeply concerned at her daughter’s
conduct, the conjugal quarrels, and the intimacy with Lord
Byron, which was so much talked of in the world. ‘Poor
dear mamma was miserable; she prevailed on me at length to
go to Ireland with her and papa.’ On their departure, Lord
Byron wrote to his dearest Caroline a most peculiar letter,
abounding, indeed, in high-flown protestations, assuring her
he was hers only, hers entirely; that he would with pleasure
give up everything for her, both here and beyond the grave;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>that he was ready to fly with her, when and whenever she
might appoint, etc.; at the same time reminding her of her
duty to her husband and her mother—a most wonderful
mixture of false sentiment and shallow feeling, which could
only have deceived one so blinded as the recipient. ‘Byron
continued to write to me while I was in Ireland. His letters
were tender and amusing. We had arrived at Dublin, on our
way home, when my mother brought me a letter from him,—such
a letter!—I have published it in <i>Glenarvon</i>. It was
sealed with a coronet, but neither the coronet nor the initials
were his; they were Lady Oxford’s.’ Lady Caroline was
beside herself with rage and jealousy; she fell ill. They were
detained at ‘a horrid little inn’ at Rock. She arrived in
England in the most excited frame of mind. Byron complains
of her proceedings, which were of a most melodramatic nature;
she went to see him, dressed as a page; she vowed she would
stab herself, and wished some one would kill him;—‘in short,’
says the poet, ‘the Agnus is furious; you can have no idea
what things she says and does, ever since the time that I
(really from the best motives) withdrew my homage. She
actually writes me letters threatening my life.’ We have no
reference at hand to note when these lines were written, but
we believe after his marriage:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c036'>a peculiar and ambiguous form of reasoning, by which it
appeared Lady Caroline was not convinced.</p>
<p class='c035'>Byron’s well-known stanzas, ‘Farewell! if ever fondest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>prayer,’ were said to have been addressed to Lady Caroline
when he left England for ever, having quarrelled with his wife
as well as with his friend. The poem was not calculated to
conciliate the lady, and it was not long before she heard from
a third person that Byron had spoken slightingly of her to
Madame de Staël and others. She accordingly sat down, and
wrote him a long account of the childish revenge she had
taken, by burning his effigy in a bonfire, with her own hands.</p>

<p class='c035'>In her Diary she gives a touching account of her useless
endeavours to pique or persuade her poor boy into cheerfulness,
and how, when he saw her look of disappointment, he
would come and sit beside her, take her hand, and look wistfully
into her face. She had consulted many physicians, she
said, and now she would consult a <i>metaphysician</i>. Some time
ago she had met Godwin, the author, and taken one of her
sudden fancies for him. She now sat down and asked him to
come and pay her a visit at Brocket; she wished to have some
conversation with him about her son, and indeed about her
own unsettled and discontented state of mind. ‘When I saw
you last under painful circumstances, you said it rested with
myself to be happy. I fear you can only think of me with
contempt. My mind is overpowered with trifles. Would you
dislike paying me a little visit? I hold out no allurements;
if you come, it can only be from friendship. I have no
longer the excuse of youth and inexperience for being foolish,
yet I remain so. I want a few wise words of advice. No one
is more sensible of kindness from a person of high intellect. I
have such an over-abundance of activity, and nothing to do. I
feel as if I had lived five hundred years, and am neither better
nor worse than when I began. I conduce to no one’s happiness;
on the contrary, I am in the way of many. All my
beliefs and opinions are shaken as with small shocks of moral
earthquake; it is as if I were in a boat without chart or compass.’
Surely she was not wise in her selection of a navigator.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>Godwin obeyed the summons, but, as might have been
expected, brought no consolation in his train. Lady Caroline
would often in her correspondence eulogise her husband in
very high terms, and call him her guardian angel, and there
is no doubt she was proud of him; but his very forbearance
and good-humour were often a source of irritation, and she
would upbraid him with treating her as a child, though, in
reality, nothing flattered her more than to be so considered,
and in some of her early caricatures (for she often amused
herself in that way) she represents herself carried about in
Mr. Lamb’s arms as a little girl. Her father-in-law, easy-going
as he was, blamed her for her extravagance, and called
her ‘her <i>laviship</i>.’ ‘Indeed I think I am a good housewife,’
she writes to Lady Morgan, ‘and have saved William money;
but he says, “What is the use of saving with one hand if you
scatter with the other?” What is the use—that is what I am
always saying—what is the use of existing at all?’</p>

<p class='c035'>This unwholesome excitement tended to increase the
natural irascibility of her character. In her Diary she records
petty quarrels with her servants and other inmates of the
house. She at length took to authorship as a consolation,
and gives an odd account of the manner in which her literary
labours were carried on. She had a companion, who began
by acting as her amanuensis, but after a time she decided
on having an expert copyist. Even so commonplace an
arrangement must be carried out in a melodramatic manner.
She wrote the book, unknown to all, except to Miss Welsh, in
the middle of the night. ‘I sent for old Woodhead to
Melbourne House. I dressed Miss Welsh elegantly, and placed
her at my harp, while I sat at the writing-table, disguised in
the page’s clothes. The copyist naturally took Miss Welsh
for Lady Caroline, and expressed his astonishment that a
schoolboy of that age (I looked about fourteen) could be the
author of <i>Glenarvon</i>. Next time he came I received him in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>own clothes, and told him William Ormond, the young
author, was dead. When the book was finished, I sent it
to ‘William, who was delighted.’ (Query.) <i>Glenarvon</i> disappointed
the public, not so much on account of its literary
shortcomings, which might have been anticipated, but from
its lack of sufficient allusions to the separation of Lord and
Lady Byron, though there was no scarcity of abuse of the
hero. The story was too feeble and vapid to cause much
sensation, yet the authoress found publishers willing to accept
further works from the same pen, and <i>Graham Hamilton</i> and
<i>Ada Reis</i> followed.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord Byron, writing from Venice, speaking of <i>Glenarvon</i>,
says: ‘I have seen nothing of the book but the motto from
my “Corsair”:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He left a name to all succeeding times</div>
      <div class='line'>Linked with one virtue and a thousand crimes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c036'>If such be the posy, what must the ring be?—the generous
moment selected for the publication! I have not a guess at
the contents.’ A little while after, Madame de Staël lent him
the book, when he went to see her at Coppet. ‘It seems to
me that if the author had told the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, the romance would not only have been
more romantic, but more interesting. The likeness is not
good; <i>I did not sit long enough</i>.’</p>
<p class='c035'>Besides her novels, Lady Caroline sent contributions to
Annuals and Magazines, breathing eternal love and dire
remorse:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c044'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Weep for what thou’st lost, love,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Weep for what thou’st won,</div>
      <div class='line'>Weep for what thou didst not do,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And more for what thou’st done.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c045'>She often amused herself by setting her own compositions
to music very prettily.</p>

<p class='c035'>We are not told in what manner Lady Caroline received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>the tidings of Byron’s death, but we have a detailed
account of her driving one summer’s day on the Great
North Road, not far from Brocket, in an open carriage,
accompanied by her husband, when, at a turn in the road,
they came upon a long and melancholy procession. It proved
to be the funeral of a peer, from the fact that the hearse was
preceded by a horseman bearing a coronet on a cushion.
The lady stopped her carriage and asked the question whose
funeral it was. ‘We are taking Lord Byron to Newstead to
be buried,’ was the reply. The shock was terrible. Lady
Caroline reached home, more dead than alive, and fell into a
species of trance, from which the waking was slow and tedious.
She would sit for hours with her hands clasped on her lap,
silent and listless; and it was long before she could be prevailed
on to resume her usual occupations, or busy herself
with her books, music, or drawing. When the invalid was a
little better, change of air and scene was prescribed, and she
was sent abroad. She wrote from Paris to Lady Morgan,
asking her to look in a cabinet, in a certain room at Melbourne
House, where she would find a miniature<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c050'><sup>[5]</sup></a> of Lord Byron:
‘Pray send it me without delay.’ Coming back to England,
she again took up her abode at Brocket, where her
husband often visited her, although his official and Parliamentary
duties were a sufficient reason for his residing
mostly in London. When he went over to Ireland as Chief
Secretary, he kept up a regular correspondence with his wife
(now a confirmed invalid), and with those to whose care she was
consigned. In Dublin he was a frequent visitor at the house
of Lady Morgan, who was much attached to Lady Caroline,
to give her news of his wife’s health, or show her some of the
letters he received from Brocket,—such, for instance, as, ‘My
dearest William,—Since I wrote last I have been a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>sufferer. Tapping is a dreadful sensation, it turns me so deadly
cold and sick.... But everybody is so good to me. All the
members of both our families, Emily, and Caroline have been
to see me, and the whole county has called to inquire. My
dear brother, too, has been with me, and is coming again. He
reads to me, which is so soothing; but what pleased me most
of all was your dear letter, in which you said you loved me
and forgave me.’</p>

<div class='footnote c052' id='f5'>
<p class='c034'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lady Caroline Lamb bequeathed this portrait to Lady Morgan, at
whose death it was sold by auction.</p>
</div>

<p class='c035'>In proportion as her bodily health failed, so did the sufferer
become more and more gentle, patient, and grateful for kindness.
The evil spirit had been cast out. She grew so much
worse that it was deemed advisable to remove her to London
for the benefit of medical advice. On the 26th of January
1828, Lady Morgan received a letter from Mr. William Ponsonby
(afterwards Lord De Mauley), to announce his sister’s
death. ‘From the beginning of her illness,’ he says, ‘she had
no expectation of recovery, and only felt anxious to live long
enough to see Mr. Lamb once again. In this she was gratified,
and was still able to converse with him, and enjoy his society.
But for the past three days it was apparent that her strength
was rapidly declining, and on Sunday night, at about nine
o’clock, she expired without a struggle. A kinder or more
tender heart never ceased to beat, and it was a great consolation
to her and to us that her mind was fully prepared and
reconciled to the awful change. She viewed the near
approach of death with calmness, and during her long and
severe sufferings her patience never forsook her, or her
affectionate consideration for those around her. Mr. Lamb
has felt and acted as I knew he would on this sad occasion.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The friendship of the brothers-in-law had never been
interrupted. Although fully prepared for a great change in
his wife’s appearance, William Lamb was more shocked than
he expected to be. The short time that intervened between
his return and her death was marked by tenderness on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>part and affection on hers; and in after years the widower
always spoke of ‘Caroline’ with gentleness and forbearance.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Morgan thus describes her friend’s appearance: ‘A
slight tall figure, dark lustrous eyes, with fair hair and complexion;
a charming voice, sweet, low, caressing, which exercised
a wonderful influence over most people. She was
eloquent also, but had only one subject—herself. She was the
slave of imagination and of impulse.’</p>

    <div>THE WITCHES ROUND THE CAULDRON.</div>
    <div class='c000'>BEING PORTRAITS OF LADY MELBOURNE, THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE, AND MRS. DAWSON DAMER.</div>

IN the notice of Lady Melbourne we have
alluded to that lady’s taste for private
theatricals, <i>tableaux vivants</i>, and other dramatic
entertainments, and to the merry
meetings on those festive occasions. This
sketch is an interesting record of one such.
Lady Melbourne knew where to select talent and beauty:
the Duchess of Devonshire, daughter of the first Earl Spencer,
by Georgina, daughter of Stephen Poyntz, Esq. of Midgham,
near Newbury, was a beauty, a wit, and, above all, a politician.
A tribute was once paid to her charms, to our mind, better
worth remembering than the widespread story, so often told,
so often delineated, in the caricatures of the day, of how
her Grace bartered a kiss to a butcher, in exchange for
his vote in favour of the fair Whig’s political idol, Charles
James Fox. The anecdote to which we give the preference
is as follows: One day, when proceeding to the poll, the
crowd was so dense, and the mob pressed so heavily against
the coach panels, that her Grace, usually so fearless, became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>alarmed, and, stretching out her fair head, she requested a
rough and shabby member of the community to keep back a
little, and induce the others to do the same. The man, an
undoubted Irishman, stared at the charming vision for a
moment, with his short pipe suspended between his fingers,
and then burst forth, ‘God bless yer, and that I shall, and
anything else in life, so as I may light my pipe at your eyes.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Lady Melbourne was also a beauty, as her many portraits
show, without the testimony of posthumous fame, and her
features were decidedly more regular than those of her captivating
friend. Mrs. Damer was also much admired, and in
such circumstances we can easily imagine what prettily turned
compliments were paid, what flattering contrasts drawn, between
these three bewitching witches, who met, and met again,
not on a ‘blasted heath,’ but in the sylvan shades of Brocket,
and the midnight hags whom Shakespeare drew, ‘so wizen, and
so wild in their attire’!</p>

<p class='c035'>The artist, Anne Seymour, was the daughter of the Hon.
Hugh Seymour Conway, brother of the Marquis of Hertford.
She married, in 1767, the Hon. John Damer, eldest son of the
first Lord Milton. The union was far from happy, and in
1776 the eccentric and restless-minded husband shot himself.
Mrs. Damer, who had no children to engross her time and
thoughts, now gave herself up to the study and enjoyment of
art, for which purpose she travelled in Italy, France, and
Spain, mastering the languages of the countries through which
she passed; and, benefiting by the treasures of painting and
sculpture which they afforded her, she became a proficient
with her brush and her chisel, and executed many admirable
works, too numerous to be mentioned, being a frequent
exhibitor at the Royal Academy. In politics Mrs. Damer
emulated her friends, Lady Melbourne and the Duchess of
Devonshire, being a staunch Whig, while on the boards of
Brocket and White Hall she displayed much talent as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>actress. When her cousin and friend, Lord Orford, died, he
bequeathed Strawberry Hill to her, with a handsome annual
sum for its maintenance, and there she lived for some years.
In 1828 she died at her house in Upper Brook Street, and,
by her own desire, was buried at Sundridge. Her sculptor’s
tools and apron, together with the ashes of a favourite dog,
were placed with her in her coffin.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
JOHN DE WITT was born at Dort in 1625.
He was educated in the Latin School of
Dort, was at Leyden for four years with
his brother Cornelius, two years older than
himself, travelled with him in France and
England, and in 1648 went to study law
and mathematics at the Hague.</p>

<p class='c035'>It may be as well to begin by briefly depicting the
political situation of the Dutch Provinces at this period.</p>

<p class='c035'>They had for some time been divided into two parties.
One was headed by the Prince of Orange, composed of the
old nobility and of the lower orders both in town and
country, and supported by the bulk of the clergy. The other
consisted mainly of the higher classes in the large towns.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>The differences between the two parties were numerous, but
may chiefly be described as having reference to War, Trade,
and Religion. The House of Orange, by the line it had
taken at a critical moment against Philip <span class='fss'>II.</span>, by the indomitable
constancy of its Princes, and by their vast political and
military talents, had been the principal instrument of the
liberation of the Netherlands from the dominion of Spain;
but their enemies accused them of continuing the war for the
sake of their own aggrandisement much longer than was
necessary, and of thus squandering the resources and weakening
the energies of the State. They complained of the heavy
burdens laid upon commerce, and of the losses sustained by
the mercantile interest, owing to the insecure condition of the
seas. As to religion, the wealthier burgesses belonged for
the most part to the Arminian, or what we may perhaps call
the Broad Church party, and were ardently in favour of
toleration, while their opponents leaned strongly for support
upon the rigid and persecuting Calvinists. In addition to the
causes of disagreement which I have mentioned, was the conflict
between the authority of the Union, on the one hand, and,
on the other, the individual rights of each particular Province.
These provincial rights were more especially insisted upon by
those who opposed the House of Orange in the Province of
Holland itself, for they complained that though Holland paid
more towards sustaining the public burdens than all the other
Provinces put together, she was constantly outvoted and overruled
on the most important subjects of public policy.</p>

<p class='c035'>This is as full an account as our limits will permit of the
subjects of dispute between the party of the House of
Orange and the Opposition. The Opposition, we must bear
in mind, derived its chief strength from the rich merchants
and the magistrates of the large towns. These magistrates
were elected by close corporations, and were chosen in each
town, generation after generation, from a small number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>select families. It was to one of the most considerable of
these families in the town of Dort that John de Witt belonged;
he had thus the advantages and the disadvantages of having
his political party already decided for him by the accident of
his birth, and the less doubtful good fortune of finding an
open access to public life.</p>

<p class='c035'>It was while De Witt was studying at the Hague that the
struggle between the two parties in the State was brought to a
crisis. Peace had at last been made with Spain; but it
was expected that the young Prince of Orange, William <span class='fss'>II.</span>,
who had just succeeded to his father, would soon break it.
Fearing this, the Provincial Government of Holland, which
was in the hands of the burgess oligarchy, refused to pay its
share of the expenses of the troops, and directed certain
numbers to be disbanded. The Prince obtained an order
from the States-General of the United Provinces to go with a
deputation to the different towns of Holland and forbid the
local authorities from obeying the directions of the Provincial
Government. At Dort, which was the first place he visited,
he was thwarted by Jacob de Witt, John’s father, ex-burgomaster,
and one of the principal men in the town. On
returning to the Hague, he summoned Jacob de Witt and
five or six others of the leading deputies, and put them in
prison. Meanwhile, he attempted to seize Amsterdam. The
attempt failed; but the municipality of that city, in order to
avert a civil war, agreed to abandon all further opposition to
the Prince, who was now all-powerful; but at the moment
of his triumph he fell ill of the small-pox and died. His only
son was not born till a week afterwards.</p>

<p class='c035'>The rich middle-class oligarchical party now found itself
raised by fortune from complete prostration to the supreme
direction of affairs. Whether they could maintain their
position might well have been doubted. They had many
difficulties to contend with; they had against them the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>large circle of personal adherents of the House of Orange,
all the distinguished soldiers, many of the distinguished
admirals, the ancient nobility, and the mass of the common
people. They were few in number, and none of them had
yet shown any particular ability. It is in circumstances like
these that the appearance of a remarkable man affects the
current of history. Such a man appeared at this moment in
John de Witt, who had just received his first official appointment
as Pensionary of Dort. Born, as we have seen, in the
very centre of the faction which was now dominant, he
obtained at once, and without an effort, their full confidence.
On the other hand, his just and impartial nature, conspicuous
from the very first, the consummate ability which he
gradually developed, and, above all, his commanding resolution,
raised and sustained the weak party to which he
belonged. His influence extended far beyond its narrow
circle, and his name is associated with one of the most
prosperous times in the history of his country.</p>

<p class='c035'>It was not, however, for some years that De Witt filled
more than a subordinate position. Meanwhile the new
Government proved itself both feeble and unfortunate. It was
compelled by the fundamental principles of the party to push
provincial independence to an extreme that almost disintegrated
the Union. The office of Captain-General, which
had largely contributed towards holding the Union together,
was abolished, for it would assuredly have fallen into the
hands of the House of Orange. The provincial office of
Stadtholder remained vacant for the same reason. Business
had never been rapidly conducted by the Dutch; but now it
could hardly be conducted at all. The first result of this
state of things was drifting into a war with England, against
the wishes and interests of both nations, particularly of the
Dutch. Nor was the war carried on in a manner creditable
to the authorities at home. The ships were ill-fitted and ill-provisioned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>the instructions were confused, and nothing but
the genius and conduct of the admirals, Van Tromp and De
Ruyter, saved the country from overwhelming calamities. In
spite of the most desperate fighting that ever took place at
sea, and of some brilliant victories by the Dutch, they were
overmatched, blockaded, and very nearly reduced to starvation.
The ablest men in the country had for some time seen
the folly of the war and the necessity for putting an end to
it. But the breakdown in the machinery of government,
which made it difficult to carry on the war with vigour, made
it almost impossible to conclude a peace. It was now that
De Witt, appointed Grand-Pensionary of Holland, began to
play a leading part. On the one hand, he commenced
building a new fleet of larger and better ships; on the other,
he started negotiations with Cromwell, at this time Lord
Protector of England. The difficulties in his way, both in
prosecuting the war and in making peace, were almost inconceivable.
He had no actual power in his hands; nothing but
moral influence. Every measure had to be debated in each of
the Assemblies of the Seven Provinces. It was then brought
before the States-General, whose members had no authority to
decide any new point without referring it back to their constituents;
even when the States-General had come to a decision,
there was no means of binding the dissentient minority. It
is an under-statement of the case to say that no diplomacy
ever exercised throughout Europe by Cardinal Richelieu, by
William <span class='fss'>III.</span> of England, by Metternich, or by Talleyrand,
was vaster or more intricate than that required by De Witt
to bring about the end he had in view. His difficulties were
the greater that the bulk of the nation thoroughly detested the
new Government. The Orange party among the lower classes
were almost as violent now as they became later in 1672, and
De Witt went about in danger of his life. At last, by incredible
exertion and dogged resolution, joined with admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>tact and temper, by impenetrable secrecy, and, it must be
confessed, by a certain amount of duplicity, he attained his
objects. The new fleet was begun, and shortly afterwards
peace was concluded on better terms than might have been
expected.</p>

<p class='c035'>Still greater duplicity was shown in carrying out a secret
agreement whereby the State of Holland bound itself to
exclude for ever any members of the House of Orange from
the office of Stadtholder. Was this really forced upon De
Witt by Cromwell? Was his own judgment warped by prejudice?
Or was it one of those sacrifices to the passions of
a party, which, in a time of excitement, are occasionally
demanded even from the most upright Minister? It was
accomplished in a most discreditable manner; the storm
it raised when it became known shook the Seven Provinces to
their very foundation. Its immediate effect, when that storm
subsided, was to confirm the power of the class which held
the reins of Government; but the measure was pregnant with
future mischief.</p>

<p class='c035'>By the tact and tenacity shown in these proceedings, De
Witt had raised himself to so high a position that he never
again had quite the same herculean labours to go through in
carrying out his measures; but, in order to judge his abilities
fairly, we must always remember that on every occasion when
it was necessary to act, obstacles somewhat of a similar
nature had to be overcome.</p>

<p class='c035'>A cordial understanding with England lasted till the
Restoration in 1660, far more cordial, indeed, than with
France.</p>

<p class='c035'>Up to this time, almost from the commencement of its
existence, it had been the policy of the Dutch Republic to
maintain an alliance with France. But the French had come
to consider this alliance so necessary to the Republic that
they had felt themselves able to treat their allies in a most supercilious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>manner. Their armed ships had for some time been
in the habit of seizing and plundering Dutch merchantmen.
It had been impossible to obtain redress till, in 1657, Admiral
de Ruyter had orders from his Government to make reprisals,
and took two of the King’s ships. A French envoy was sent
to demand satisfaction. A rupture seemed imminent, but
matters were smoothed over, and the United Provinces came
out of the difficulty without loss of credit.</p>

<p class='c035'>In the meantime much alarm had been created in Holland
by the ambition of Charles Gustavus of Sweden, who had
engaged in a successful war with Poland, and afterwards
attacked Denmark. Denmark was in alliance with the
United Provinces, and, moreover, it was necessary for the
trade of Holland in the Baltic, which was very considerable,
that the balance of power in the North should be preserved.
After many negotiations, and an abortive attempt to make a
treaty with Sweden, the Dutch assisted Denmark with a
powerful fleet and a small body of troops. They had an
obstinate naval engagement, by which Copenhagen was
saved, and in the following year they destroyed some of
the largest of the Swedish men-of-war, which they succeeded
in surprising and outnumbering. Charles Gustavus died
suddenly, and peace was soon afterwards made.</p>

<p class='c035'>A desultory war had all this time been going on with
Portugal, in order to obtain compensation for losses sustained
by the Dutch in Brazil, which does not come within our
limits to describe. This war was chiefly carried on in the
East Indies, where the Dutch conquered the rich island of
Ceylon. Peace was finally made with Portugal in 1661,
Portugal paying a heavy indemnity for the Brazil losses.</p>

<p class='c035'>In all these matters De Witt had become more and more
the principal mover. As to home affairs, his reputation, and
the power which was derived from it, were not confined to his
own province of Holland, for we find him about this period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>chosen by the nobility, first of Friesland, and then of Overyssel,
to settle their internal disputes.</p>

<p class='c035'>The office of Grand-Pensionary was a five years’ appointment.
It had been renewed to De Witt in 1658, and in 1663
it had become such a matter of course that he should fill it,
that even his opponents gave a tacit consent to his remaining.
Having proved himself necessary, it was impossible that he
should not continue to hold the most honourable place in the
Government. Not that his place as Grand-Pensionary gave
him any real power. I have already remarked, and it is
important to bear in mind, that by the strange system now
prevailing, no official whatever possessed more than a moral
influence. Whenever anything of importance was to be done,
some person was appointed for that particular purpose, and
this person was now almost always either De Witt or his
brother, generally the former. For instance, there was at
this time a dispute between the Prince of East Friesland and
his subjects, which threatened to be serious. John de Witt
was at once appointed to go at the head of a deputation to
mediate between the contending parties. I need hardly add
that his mediation was at once successful; and there was
soon to be a still greater scope for the display of his abilities,
as a war with England was impending.</p>

<p class='c035'>Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> was now on the throne of England, and there
was a natural antagonism between him, as uncle to the
Prince of Orange, and the party which now governed Holland.
Besides this, the English nation had always been jealous of
the commercial prosperity of the Dutch, and they had not
yet become sufficiently aware of the extent to which the
power of France was increasing, or the necessity for a Dutch
alliance in order to check it.</p>

<p class='c035'>We cannot be surprised, therefore, that this war should
have broken out; it began on the coast of Africa, and soon
became general. De Witt was, of course, at once appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>Chief Commissioner for the direction of the navy, and by his
personal exertions at Amsterdam and other places he succeeded
in fitting out a considerable fleet, very differently
equipped and provisioned to what had been the case in the
war with Cromwell. This fleet, however, under the command
of Opdam, engaged the English in the beginning of
June 1665, and suffered a tremendous and most disastrous
defeat. Opdam was killed, and the other admirals were at
daggers drawn with each other. Such was the general confusion
and discouragement, and such the general instinct to
turn to De Witt in any great emergency, that though he had
never yet had any military or naval experience whatever, the
chief command was at once thrust upon him. He knew well
how invidious his position would be, and it was in spite of the
earnest persuasion of his personal friends to the contrary,
that, at the call of duty, he accepted the office.</p>

<p class='c035'>The fleet had been driven into the Texel, and was shut in
there by a contrary wind. To Holland, who depended for
her very existence upon supplies from abroad, and whose
East Indian ships at this very moment required protection
for their safe passage, it was absolutely necessary that the
fleet should at once put to sea. But the seamen unanimously
represented that as the wind then stood this was impossible.
De Witt, though no sailor, was a great mathematician. He
had read deeply and written ably on the subject, and he was
now to put his knowledge to practical use. He proved by
calculation that it was just possible, even with this adverse
wind, to sail out by one passage, then called the Spaniards’
Gat. The pilots now declared that in the Spaniards’ Gat
there was not more than ten feet of water, and that this was
not sufficient. De Witt took a boat, personally sounded it,
and found everywhere a depth of at least twenty feet. He
himself superintended the carrying out of the largest ship in
the fleet, and was followed by all the rest.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>He now had to exercise his diplomatic abilities in order to
reconcile the two admirals under his command—De Ruyter
and the younger Van Tromp. He succeeded in smoothing
down their mutual animosities, and in attaching them both
personally to himself. But the sailors still grumbled, not
unnaturally, at being commanded by an unknown and inexperienced
landsman, and it was not till a violent storm
arose that he had an opportunity of winning their esteem.
For two days and two nights, without food and without rest,
he remained on deck, infusing courage into others, as only a
really brave man can do, working himself, and, what seems to
have been unusual, forcing his officers also by his example
to work with their own hands. He gradually became the
idol of the men, showing particular concern for their comfort
and welfare, while, at the same time, by his tact and
good management, he avoided giving any offence to the
officers.</p>

<p class='c035'>This expedition, however, does not seem on the whole
to have been very successful, probably on account of the
roughness of the weather. On his return he found the people
violently irritated by false reports of the intermeddling of
himself and the other deputies whom he had taken with him.
He was particularly supposed to have thwarted De Ruyter,
but, unfortunately for his enemies, De Ruyter happened at
this time to come to the Hague, and to choose for his lodgings
the house of the very man who was reported to have
behaved so ill. De Ruyter wrote a letter to the States, not
only vindicating, but warmly praising him. De Witt also
wrote an elaborate account of all his proceedings; the tide
of opinion changed. He received an enthusiastic vote of
thanks, and the offer of a large present, which he declined.</p>

<p class='c035'>De Witt only left the fleet in order to plunge deep into
the tangled thicket of negotiation. Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> was indeed
nominally an ally, but he was very slack and very procrastinating;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>delighted to see his two neighbours tearing each other
to pieces, and not anxious to help the Dutch more than he
was obliged. Denmark was making perfidious overtures, first
to England, and then to Holland. De Witt eventually succeeded
in forming an alliance with her, and also with Brandenburg,
but for a long time she required watching with
constant attention. Meanwhile Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> had induced the
Bishop of Münster to invade the United Provinces with 8000
men. The Bishop proved to be a bad general, was threatened
by Brandenburg in his rear, and was induced by De Witt to
leave the country before he had done much harm. But
Holland had received a warning to which she ought to have
attended. The army was evidently no longer the same as
in the old days of Maurice and Frederick Henry. There
were ugly stories of incompetent officers, and of men unwilling
to expose themselves to the fire of the enemy. But peace
was made with the Bishop; men’s minds were diverted by the
fierce fighting which was going on at sea; and all this was
hushed up, and forgotten for a time.</p>

<p class='c035'>All parties in the State were now united in a vigorous
prosecution of the war. De Witt, who, as I have said, seems
to have been the one man besides his brother who looked
after everything, had taken care that the education of the
young Prince of Orange should not be neglected. Though
he opposed with all his might intrusting him with the offices
held by his ancestors, he was magnanimous enough to provide
that, if he did obtain them, he should be qualified to fill them.
The two factions seemed now, in the face of a common danger,
to have been for the moment reconciled. A large and well-furnished
fleet took the sea in the summer of 1666 under De
Ruyter and the younger Van Tromp; on June I they met
the English, under Prince Rupert and the Duke of Albemarle.
One of those desperate sea-battles took place which form the
peculiar feature of the period of which we are writing. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>English were outnumbered, but not more so than they have
been in many of the most decisive of their victories over other
nations. For four days the desperate struggle continued, and
it ended in what the Dutch called a victory, and the English a
drawn battle. On July 25 another engagement took place.
The English, who had by this time been reinforced, were now
successful, but only after the most desperate fighting. Van
Tromp had become separated from De Ruyter, either from
accident or by design; but De Ruyter kept his station till
night against overwhelming numbers, and next morning
moved sullenly away, frequently exclaiming, ‘My God! is there
not one among all these bullets which will put an end to my
miserable life?’</p>

<p class='c035'>Not only were the Dutch defeated, but dissension of the
most violent nature broke out between the two admirals, and
among all the officers of the fleet. The Provinces were in
consternation; De Witt was sent out to endeavour to put
things straight. Van Tromp’s commission was taken from
him, and some of the captains were punished; but the most
guilty are said to have escaped on account of their family connections.</p>

<p class='c035'>Both nations were now beginning to be desirous of peace.
Holland had been reduced to great distress, and Charles
had found the war attended with little glory and much
expense. De Witt, afraid of the intrigues of the Orange party,
refused to receive an Ambassador at the Hague, but negotiations
were begun at Paris. It was agreed as a basis that each
country should retain whatever possessions they at the moment
had. This was, on the whole, favourable to England, but some
trifling matters remained to be adjusted, and England meanwhile
proposed immediate disarmament. De Witt, knowing
the character of King Charles, and seeing his opportunity, persuaded
the States to refuse. Charles, as he expected, thinking
the matter virtually settled, and wanting his money for other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>purposes, made no preparations for the coming year. De Witt,
however, equipped a large fleet, which he despatched, early
in the summer, under the command of his brother Cornelius,
straight to the Thames. Sheerness was taken, and the Dutch
sailed up the river. The Medway was guarded by a chain
drawn across it, and by three ships of war; the chain was
broken, and the ships burnt. Three more ships were burnt
at Chatham; the Dutch guns were heard in London, and
there was general consternation. Charles immediately sent
orders to give way upon all the points still insisted on by the
Dutch, and peace was signed at Breda.</p>

<p class='c035'>Thus ended the war between England and Holland. We
may console our national pride by feeling that our ill success
was as much owing to our own imbecile Government as to the
merits of our enemy, but it will be impossible to refuse a tribute
of admiration to the latter. We have grown so accustomed
since, in reading of our many glorious wars, to look
with pride upon the map, and to compare our own small
island with the large proportions of our various opponents,
that it almost amuses us, now that it is so long ago, for once
to observe the contrary, and to remember that we were formerly
defied and held at bay by a country of almost exactly
the same size as Wales.</p>

<p class='c035'>I have said that it was some time before England and
Holland recognised the fact, to us so obvious, that it was
the common interest of both countries to join together against
France. The rising power of that country, and the ambition
displayed by her King, now began to open the eyes of her
neighbours. Even Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> was for a few years persuaded
to adopt the course required by reason; after some preliminary
negotiation, Sir William Temple was sent to the Hague,
where, with a celerity quite unexampled in anything at that
time dependent on the movements of the Dutch Government,
he concluded a Triple Alliance between England, Holland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>and Sweden. This was carried out by De Witt. He had
for some time been convinced of the necessity for it, but he
had great difficulties in his way, as some of the Provinces
were in favour of the suicidal policy of an agreement with
France for the division of the Spanish territory in Flanders;
De Witt only carried his point by a breach of the Constitution.
He persuaded the States-General to sign the treaty at once,
instead of referring it back to the local Assemblies, as they
were in strictness bound to do. Had he not felt sure of his
position with the people, he could only have done this at the
risk of his head; but there was no danger. He was at this
moment at the very height of popularity and fame. There is
some interest in contemplating a great man at such a moment,
particularly when there is in the background a dark shadow of
impending fate. The interest is in this instance increased
by the modest dignity of the hero; there is something very
striking in the picture drawn by Temple of the life and habits
of one who at this period shone prominently among the most
conspicuous figures in Europe,—his simple dress, his frugal
house-keeping, and his single servant. He lived upon a salary
of £300 a year, shortly to be increased to £700; and he
steadily refused all presents from the State; accepting with
difficulty a small one of £1500 from the rich families of his
own Province. His third term of office now expired: he
was again elected for a fourth period of five years; it was to
be the last time.</p>

<p class='c035'>We are now to witness first the decline, and then the
sudden close, of this memorable career. De Witt’s popularity
with the multitude was never more than a temporary matter;
the Prince of Orange was now growing up, and had already
displayed more than ordinary ability. He was admitted into
the Council, and he gathered round him a considerable party—not
large enough to assume the management of affairs, but
sufficiently so to cause division and weakness. On the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>hand, the party of burgomasters and rich citizens—the
burgess oligarchy, as we have called it—to which De Witt
properly belonged, and which had brought him into power,
became divided within itself, one portion only giving him undeviating
support. De Witt had ceased, to a certain extent,
to be a party man, and every Minister in a Constitutional
Government who does this runs the risk of being deserted by
his followers. We have seen that, even in the height of his
power, he was unable to procure the punishment of the
aristocratic sea-captains who had misbehaved, and he was now
equally unsuccessful in his attempts to remodel and reorganise
the army, which was largely officered from the same
class. But perhaps he did not push his attempts in this direction
with as much vigour as he ought, for he relied largely
upon diplomacy for preventing the necessity of employing any
army at all.</p>

<p class='c035'>Louis meanwhile applied all his energy and skill to dissolve
the Triple Alliance. He certainly succeeded in persuading
the Dutch to enter into negotiations, but to this De
Witt only consented with the utmost reluctance, evidently
because he could not help himself; or we may feel pretty
sure that he would have succeeded in keeping his country
firm to its true interest. In England, however, things were
very different: it was the time of the Cabal—the worst and
most profligate Ministry we have ever had. By bribery of the
Ministers, by the promise of a large subsidy to the King, and
with the help of the beautiful Duchess of Portsmouth, whom
he sent over for the purpose, Louis persuaded our Government
suddenly to reverse their whole policy, to break all
their engagements, and to declare war against the United
Provinces.</p>

<p class='c035'>The French were already prepared. An army of 130,000
men, commanded, under the King, by Condé, Turenne,
Luxembourg, and all the most distinguished generals of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>France, advanced upon the frontier. The Dutch troops were
panicstricken and demoralised; the army had, as we know,
been allowed to get into a very unsatisfactory condition. De
Witt had relied chiefly upon the navy for maintaining the
greatness of his country; but he had not been insensible to
the deficiencies of the other branch of the service. He had,
as I have said, tried hard, but not hard enough, to remedy
them. His party had always been pledged to the reduction
of the troops in order to keep down the taxation; the
adherents of the House of Orange, who comprised the best
officers of the country, had been unwilling to serve under the
present Government, and the Government had been equally
unwilling to employ them. On the other hand, the rich
citizens, whose political support was the main prop of the
Administration, had insisted upon all the best commands
being conferred upon their sons and other relations, who
were too often utterly incompetent. The French passed the
Rhine with only a faint show of opposition, and, scattering
their enemies before them, marched almost to the very
suburbs of Amsterdam. In the meantime the Prince of
Orange had been made, first Captain-General of the United
Provinces, and then Stadtholder of Holland and Zealand;
his partisans were everywhere triumphant, and his opponents,
particularly after a gallant but indecisive naval engagement,
and a vain effort by De Witt to make peace, were utterly
crushed and discredited. Now comes the tragic termination
of our story. Cornelius de Witt had just distinguished himself
highly in the sea-fight of Solebay, but, on the testimony
of one of the most infamous of mankind, he was accused of
the preposterous charge of attempting to poison the Prince of
Orange. He was put to the torture, which he endured with
heroic constancy, and nothing could be wrung from him.
But he was sentenced to be banished. John de Witt, whose
assassination had already been attempted a short time before,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>went to convey his brother out of prison, and start him on
his journey. The prison was besieged by an armed mob,
who blockaded the door, and eventually broke into the
room, where they found the two brothers—Cornelius in
bed, shattered by the torture which he had recently undergone,
and John, sitting upon the foot of the bed, calmly
reading his Bible. Cornelius, whose fiery and impetuous
nature formed a contrast to the composure and self-control
of John, rose, in spite of his weakness, and angrily bade the
intruders begone. John, having tried in vain to reason with
them, put his arm round his brother, and assisted him to
descend the stairs. In the courtyard they were hustled by
the crowd, separated, and eventually murdered,—John, as
he fell, covering his face, like Cæsar, with his cloak.</p>

<p class='c035'>The end of De Witt’s political career was disastrous, and
it is not easy to assign to him his proper place among the
statesmen of the world. I think, however, it should be on
the whole a high one; as to actual work done, he merely
showed that Holland could maintain her proud position
independently of the House of Orange. The great men of
that House, who came before and after him, under whom
the United Provinces were created a nation, and obtained
a world-wide renown, under whom, in a death-struggle with
first one and then the other, they successfully resisted all the
strength of the two mightiest monarchies in the world—those
Princes, William the Silent, Maurice, and William <span class='fss'>III.</span>, have
thrown De Witt rather into the shade. It is only when we
take into account the difficulties he had to contend with that
his rare abilities become fully apparent. One of his biographers
has invidiously compared his character with that of Cromwell,
who led a rival Republic at about the same time. But it
seems to me that there are no materials for a comparison;
what De Witt might have done as the all-powerful chief of a
large and well-disciplined army is an unknown quantity. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>the other hand, how would the great Protector, with his
irritable temper and his unintelligible speeches, have succeeded
in doing the work of De Witt? We must remember
that Cromwell at the most critical period only saved himself
and his country by turning out half his Parliament into
the street. He cut the Gordian knot; while De Witt was
compelled to be continually untying it. There is a good
simile, supposed to have been used by an illustrious statesman
of the present day as regards his own position, but far less
applicable to him than to the Pensionary: ‘De Witt was like
a man out hunting upon a mule.’</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
